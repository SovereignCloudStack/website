<p>Dan Smith and Julia Kreger of Red Hat and Jay Faulkner of G-Research
noticed a vulnerability in image processing for Ironic, in which a
specially crafted image could be used by an authenticated user to
exploit undesired behaviors in qemu-img, including possible unauthorized
access to potentially sensitive data.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2024-44082">CVE-2024-44082</a>.</p>

<p>Similar issues have been found and addressed in other projects of OpenStack before:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>In the reference implementation of <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a>,
Ironic is shipped and thus installations are advised to update the ironic images used.</p>

<h3 id="updating-ironic-images">Updating ironic images</h3>

<p>If the OpenStack Ironic service is not used, it is not necessary to execute these steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>update the OSISM manager to version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7.1.3</code> as usual (detailed instructions in
the <a href="https://osism.tech/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/manager">Upgrade Guide for the OSISM Manager</a>)</li>
  <li>Pull all Ironic images in advance with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osism apply -a pull ironic</code></li>
  <li>Upgrade the Ironic service with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osism apply -a upgrade ironic</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In release 7.1.3 of OSISM, only the images of the OpenStack Ironic services were rebuilt.
It is not necessary to upgrade other OpenStack services after updating the manager.</p>

<h2 id="scs-provider-status">SCS provider status</h2>

<p>To our knowledge none of the providers that are using the SCS reference implementation
are making use of Ironic and as such are not affected by this vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="embargo">Embargo</h2>

<p>The issue has been reported by Dan Smith, Julia Kreger and Jay Faulkner in private to
the OpenStack  Vulnerability Management Team.
The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address
the issue with fixes and an embargo date
has been set to Wednesday, 2024-09-04, 1600 UTC.
At this point in time, the patches will get merged and an OpenStack Security Advisory
(<a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-004.html">OSSA-2024-003</a>) will
be published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue
<a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/2071740">#2071740</a>, which should be
publically accessible after the advisory has been published.</p>

<p>Under the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with
a select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and
protect their user data in time for the publication.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>The fixed code allows Ironic and the Ironic-Python-Agent (IPA) to pre-screen images
before passing them to qemu-img. You should patch both of them because in some popular
deployment configurations, it is possible for images to bypass the
Ironic conductor for more efficient image downloads.
OSISM will publish (SCS R6.1.3) with fixed Ironic components this week.</p>

<p>OpenStack supports users to upload custom VM images in a number of formats
to be used for creating Virtual Machines. The simplest is a raw copy of a harddisk,
while other formats such as QCOW2 and VMDK are more advanced in being compressed
and allowing for embedding additional information. They also support referencing
other files. The latter feature needs to be controlled by OpenStack to avoid
exposing sensitive files. OpenStack thus disallows such external references
for customer images. The protections were found to be incomplete before which
lead to 
<a href="https://scs.community/de/security/2023/01/24/cve-2022-47951/">CVE-2022-47951</a>
and
<a href="https://scs.community/de/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/">CVE-2024-32498</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the last fixes with CVE-2024-32498 still were incomplete:
Arnaud Morin (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Nova. By supplying a raw format
image which is actually a specially crafted QCOW2 image with a backing file
path or VMDK flat image with a descriptor file path, an authenticated user may
convince systems to return a copy of the referenced file’s contents from the
server resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Nova
deployments are affected.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2024-40767">CVE-2024-40767</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> reference implementation
(by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>) runs these services in containers and thus
most files from the hypervisor’s file system are not directly accessible from
inside the container via this vulnerability. However, this depends on the
service inside the container. Some services have access to data from the
hypervisor or they contain sensitive data themselves (e.g. credentials to
connect to other services), and thus they are accessible by a potential
attacker. They have also access to log files from the services which may
expose sensitive data.</p>

<p><em>To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated
user of the platform.</em></p>

<p>We were <em>not</em> able to exploit this vulnerability in systems that included
the hotfix patches for 
<a href="https://scs.community/de/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/">CVE-2024-32498</a>
in our testing.
Nova did treat the VMDK and QCOW images declared as raw as raw (as did
Cinder, but Cinder is not suspected of mistreating them).
Boot disks created by Nova from the crafted VMDK and QCOW2 images contain
the raw contents of the images, without their external references being
resolved and thus without exposing any external content.
This is probably caused by SCS <em>not</em> changing the default to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images=False</code>. We currently are not aware of working exploits
without that (non-default) setting.</p>

<p>We would argue that mislabeled images should better be rejected early, as
the investigation chain may otherwise be confused which has the potential
to cause exploitable vulnerabilities. So we still highly recommend to patch
the weakness soon.</p>

<p>Operators that are using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images=False</code> in their nova config are
advised to apply the fixes urgently.</p>

<h2 id="embargo">Embargo</h2>

<p>The issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in
private. The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address
the issue with fixes and an embargo date
has been set to Tuesday, 2024-07-23, 15:00 UTC (17:00 CEST). At this point in
time, the patches will get merged and the OpenStack Security Advisory
<!--TODO: Fix reference!-->
(<a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-002.html">OSSA-2024-002</a>) will
be published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2071734">#2071734</a>, which should become
publically accessible after the lift of the embargo and the publication
of this advisory.</p>

<p>Under the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with
a select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and
protect their user data in time for the publication.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>Temporary workarounds that would disable image uploads for QCOW2
and VMDK formats are not desirable and incomplete, as images can also
be created from volumes, which would also have to be blocked.
The complexity of doing all the changes exceeds the complexity of
deploying the fixes.
A better workaround would be to <em>undo</em> the setting of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images=False</code>
in the nova configuration, as this stops all known exploitable code paths
from being used.</p>

<p>There are patches from the upstream OpenStack developers available. They work
by rejecting images in Nova where contents and the claimed format do not match
and require that a format inspector is available prior to further processing
them. This provides effective protection against confusing Nova’s image
handling.</p>

<p>Note that the upstream changes also include improvements to the handling
of ISO images from Jens Harbott (OSISM), which have further tighten the
inspection and which have been merged and backported upstream already without
having received a separate advisory (due to not having fixed known exploitable
situations).</p>

<p>The reference implementation for the IaaS layer of Sovereign Cloud Stack
is provided by the OSISM project – the OSISM team normally builds the
artifacts in a completely public process. To avoid waiting for a few
hours to have all image builds (nova-compute containers)
completed and tested after the disclosure date,
the OSISM project has built private images beforehand which we have tested
to protect against all known scenarios in which these image files are used.
These images were handed to our SCS operators a few hours ahead of time
(without a detailed description) to allow them to protect their infrastructure.</p>

<p>Instructions to install the fixed containers (hotfix on top of
<a href="https://osism.tech/de/docs/release-notes/">OSISM 7.0.x/OSISM 7.1.0</a>):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
# Override nova-compute image in your configuration repository:

nova_compute_image: "{{ my_registry_kolla }}/{{ my_namespace2 }}/nova-compute"
EOT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, the nova compute image will be downloaded and rolled out on all nova compute nodes:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>osism apply <span class="nt">-a</span> pull nova <span class="nt">-l</span> compute     <span class="c"># optional</span>
osism apply <span class="nt">-a</span> refresh-containers nova <span class="nt">-l</span> compute
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you are not yet on R6 (OSISM 7.0.x), replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stable-2023.2</code> with the version you are on 
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stable-2023.1</code> if you are on R5 (OSISM 6.x).</p>

<p>Note that the above instructions do NOT contain cinder and glance images; they should
have been fixed already with the installation of fixes for CVE-2024-32498 or with
the rollout of OSISM 7.1.0.</p>

<p>The deployment will have the following user-visible effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VM (compute service) operations will not be available for some seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most users won’t notice this. Please note that running workloads will not be
affected at all.</p>

<p>After the upstream patches have been merged in the hours after the disclosure
date, OSISM will build, test and publish an official 7.1.1 release
containing the updated containers (nova-compute, glance-api, cinder-volume)
as well as a fix for octavia-api. Please refer to the
<a href="https://osism.tech/docs/release-notes/osism-7/">OSISM release notes</a>.
You can upgrade from this hotfix toiOSISM 7.1.1 using the regular upgrade mechanism.</p>

<p>If your exposure is low (e.g. private cloud or <em>not</em> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images=False</code>)
you may decide to wait for the regular 7.1.1 and go there directly from 7.x.</p>

<p>Warning: If you are still on OSISM 7.0.x (not 7.1.x yet) and create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images.yml</code> as
described here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osism apply -a pull</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osism apply -a refresh-containers</code>
will use the base 7.0.x containers with just the single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nova_compute</code>
override which would make you vulnerable to the glance and cinder based
attacks from CVE-2024-32498 again.
We recommend to avoid this by using the latest 7.1.0 release.
If you can’t, you can either ensure you avoid pulling and refreshing containers
other than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nova_compute</code> one or you construct a combined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images.yml</code> from the
description in <a href="https://scs.community/de/security/2024/07/02/cve-2024-32498/">CVE-2024-32498</a>
and the above section. The latter would ensure you have all needed image overrides for
both CVEs.</p>

<h2 id="have-my-systems-been-compromised">Have my systems been compromised?</h2>

<p>Providers that are unable to patch this issue on the day of the release
and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images=False</code> in their nova configuration
need to consider the possibility of having been attacked. In this case,
passwords/keys for internal communication should be considered to be
leaked and will need to be rotated to reestablish the defense-in-depth
lines. We recommend providers check for suspicious image operations
(QCOW2 and VMDK image registrations, snapshots with QCOW2 signature) in
their logs for the time after the embargo lift.
In particular, every QCOW2 image that has been uploaded should be investigated
for the datafile property; it should be assumed that images that have been
registered and removed again contain the exploit.
VMDK images with external Flatfile references (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createType="monolithicFlat"</code>)
are suspicious as well. Evil images should also be pruned from the image cache.</p>

<h2 id="patch-status-of-scs-clouds">Patch status of SCS clouds</h2>

<p>Our publically known providers of SCS IaaS platforms have all been
notified and have started to ensure that their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_cow_images</code> setting
does not expose them and have started the rollout of updated images which
we were able to provide them privately a few hours ahead of time (without
sharing all the details on the issue). We expect that none of them has
any exploitable vulnerability left  open by the time this gets public.
Please refer to their communication for precise information on the
patch status.</p>

<p>Martin Kaesberger has reported that the protection for QCOW2 was incomplete
and allowed for an external datafile to slip through.</p>

<p>By creating a QCOW2 file with this feature and registering it with the
OpenStack image service, files from the host system within the Cinder, Nova and
Glance containers can be exposed. This way, sensitive information can be
exfiltrated (Information Disclosure).</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2024-32498">CVE-2024-32498</a>.</p>

<p>This issue is similar in its effects to a VMDK specific vulnerability
<a href="https://scs.community/de/security/2023/01/24/cve-2022-47951/">CVE-2022-47951</a>
that was addressed 18 months ago.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> reference implementation
(by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>) runs these services in containers and thus

<p><em>To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated
user of the platform.</em></p>

<p>We are able to reproduce this issue on unpatched platforms using the SCS
reference implementation. The exploit consists in registering an offending
QCOW2 file and then creating a volume from it which will leak information
from a referenced file in the Cinder container on the host system.</p>

<!--TODO: Search for ways to exploit this-->
<p>Information that can be accessed this way are keys for database access or
for talking to the storage system. While neither database nor storage are
reachable by cloud users, the exposure of these secrets removes these
protections for defense-in-depth. A single further exploit would now
immediately lead to a massive privilege escalation.
We have not found a way to use the exposed data to <em>directly</em> gain privileges
(such as admin access to the IaaS cloud layer), but we can not exclude that
highly skilled attackers can.</p>

<p>In any case, this vulnerability is very severe and operators of OpenStack
platforms are advised to deploy fixed versions as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in

<p>A temporary workaround would be to disallow QCOW2 image registrations.
Note however that images can also be created from volumes, not just via
customer upload and volume snapshots with a QCOW2 signature might be
misdetected as QCOW2 images prior to the fixes.</p>

<p>There are patches from the upstream OpenStack developers available. They work
by analyzing the QCOW2 images and refusing their usage if datafiles are being
used. Such images will no longer be accepted and thus can no longer be used to
exfiltrate sensitive files. The mitigation does <em>not</em> apply upon upload of
such images (the Glance service just stores the image file without looking at
it unless conversion is enabled), but upon usage. The mitigation thus applies
to Glance, Cinder and Nova and protects against the conversion of offending
images (Glance) and their use when creating VMs (Nova) or volumes (Cinder).</p>

<p>We are able to confirm that the previously successful attacks are addressed
by the fixes. QCOW2 files with datafile references are no longer converted
by the image service (Glance) nor will existing images with such properties be
used by the compute service (Nova) nor the Block Storage Service (Cinder).</p>

<p>If you are not on R6 (OSISM 7.0.x), replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stable-20232</code> with the version you are on 
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stable-20231</code> if you are on R5 (OSISM 6.x).</p>

<p>This will cause new images to be downloaded and started on the hosts.
The deployment will have the following user-visible effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The glance-API will be unavailable for some seconds</li>
  <li>Volume control operations (e.g. creating a new volume) and the cinder API will
be unavailable for some seconds.</li>
  <li>VM (compute service) operations and the nova API will not be available for
some seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most users won’t notice this. Please note that running workloads will not be
affected at all.</p>

<p>Soon after the disclosure date, OSISM will publish an official 7.0.6 release
containing the updated containers (nova-compute, glance-api, cinder-volume)
as well as a fix for octavia-api. Please refer to the the
<a href="https://osism.tech/docs/release-notes/osism-7/">OSISM release notes</a>.
You can upgrade from this hotfix to 7.0.6 using the regular upgrade mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="have-my-systems-been-compromised">Have my systems been compromised?</h2>

<p>Providers that are unable to patch this issue on the day of the release
need to consider the possibility of having been attacked. In this case,
passwords/keys for internal communication should be considered to be
leaked and will need to be rotated to reestablish the defense-in-depth
lines. We recommend providers check for suspicious image operations
(QCOW2 image registrations, snapshots with QCOW2 signature) in their logs
for the time after the embargo lift.
In particular, every image that has been uploaded should be investigated
for the datafile property; it should be assumed that images that have been
registered and removed again contain the exploit.</p>

<h2 id="patch-status-of-scs-clouds">Patch status of SCS clouds</h2>

<p>Our publically known providers of SCS IaaS platforms have all been
notified and started to deploy the updated images which we were able
to provide them privately a few hours ahead of time (without sharing
all the details on the issue). We expect them to have completed the
rollout at the time this gets public.
Please refer to their communication for precise information on the
patch status.</p>

<p>Multiple versions of OVN (Open Virtual Network) are vulnerable to
crafted BFD packets potentially causing denial of service.</p>

<p>OVN supports configuration of gateway chassis and high-availability
chassis groups (via the Gateway_Chassis and HA_Chassis_Group tables in
the OVN_Northbound database).  These group cluster nodes (chassis)
together and provide high availability to them.  OVN logical switch and
router ports can be configured to reference such groups.  In this case
the traffic forwarding decision is influenced by the liveness of the
chassis listed in the group.</p>

<p>In such scenarios OVN automatically enables the OVS Bidirectional
Forwarding Detection (BFD) functionality to monitor the health of remote
nodes and tunnels between them.</p>

<p>BFD packets are transmitted in-band in tunnels that connect OVN chassis,
along with other traffic.  And, by default, OVS will process any BFD
packets received on a tunnel port with BFD enabled.  That makes it
possible for a VM or container connected to an OVN logical switch port
to send BFD packets that will be tunneled to another node and processed
by OVS, potentially changing the BFD state and affecting the forwarding
decisions.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2182">CVE-2024-2182</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> reference
implementation (by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>) comes with and utilizes 
OVN. The upcoming Release 6 of the SCS reference implementation will
not be vulnerable to this as Release 6 will contain the OVN <a href="https://www.ovn.org/en/releases/changelog_v24.03.1/">version 24.03.1</a>.</p>

<p>A way to determine if BFD will be used is to issue the following
commands on the node that runs the OVN central components:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ docker exec -it ovn_nb_db ovn-nbctl --columns name,gateway_chassis list logical_router_port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the above command returns more than a single gateway chassis
reference for a given port that means OVS BFD has been automatically
enabled.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ docker exec -it ovn_nb_db ovn-nbctl --columns name,ha_chassis list ha_chassis_group
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same applies if the above command returns groups that contain more
than one chassis.</p>

<p>In any case, operators of OpenStack platforms are advised to deploy fixed versions.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>For any version of OVN, in order to prevent the issue, an ACL (Access
Control List) rule can be added to drop BFD packets originated from
logical ports.</p>

<p>For example, the following shell script would configure ACLs on all
existing OVN logical switches:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  for sw in $(docker exec -it ovn_nb_db ovn-nbctl --bare --columns name list logical_switch); do
      docker exec -it ovn_nb_db ovn-nbctl acl-add $sw from-lport 32767 'udp &amp;&amp; udp.dst == 3784' drop
  done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way
because this will also drop legitimate BFD traffic originated by the
workloads connected to logical switch ports, e.g., BFD sessions
established with external entities.</p>

<p>For the currently maintained version SCS R5 (OSISM 6.0.x), OVN has been updated to <a href="https://www.ovn.org/en/releases/changelog_v23.06.3/">23.06.3</a>.
Updated images have been built by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a> and are available to be installed.</p>

<p>To install the fixed OVN images, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ovn_tag: "2023.1"</code> in the configuration repository in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environments/kolla/configuration.yml</code>.
Afterwards run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osism apply -a upgrade ovn</code>.</p>

<p>This will deploy the latest OVN images for OSISM 6.0.x series (SCS R5, using OpenStack 2023.1 (Antelope)), pulling OVN 23.06.3.
This only replaces the OVN image and no service interruption is to be expected.</p>

<p>Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to crafted Geneve
packets causing invalid memory accesses and potential denial of service.
Triggering the vulnerability requires that Open vSwitch has flow hardware
offload with Linux TC flower enabled (other_config:hw-offload=true).
It is not enabled by default.</p>

<p>The issue is caused by insufficient validation of Geneve metadata
fields in the offload path.  Open vSwitch versions 2.12 and newer are
affected.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3966">CVE-2023-3966</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> reference
implementation (by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>) comes with and utilizes 
Open vSwitch. While hardware offloading is not enabled by default most
environments will have it enabled.</p>

<p>The current state of configuration can be checked with this command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dragon@manager:~$ docker exec -it openvswitch_vswitchd ovs-vsctl get Open_vSwitch . other_config:hw-offload

"true"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is typically enabled through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openvswitch_hw_offload: "yes"</code> in the host vars or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configuration.yml</code>.</p>

<p>In any case, operators of OpenStack platforms are advised to deploy fixed versions.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>For any version of Open vSwitch, disabling flow hardware offload will
prevent the issue (setting other_config:hw-offload=false and reboot
the system).  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability
this way because it may impact the overall system throughput.</p>

<p>By default, flow hardware offload support is not enabled.</p>

<p>Open vSwitch has been updated to <a href="https://www.openvswitch.org/releases/NEWS-3.1.4.txt">version 3.1.4</a>.
Updated images have been built by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a> and are available to be installed.</p>

<p>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openvswitch_tag: "2023.1"</code> in the configuration repository in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environments/kolla/configuration.yml</code>.

<p>This will deploy the latest openvswitch images for OSISM 6.0.x series (SCS R5, using OpenStack Antelope), pulling openvswitch 3.1.4.
This only replaces the Open vSwitch image. Open vSwitch only runs on the data and network plane.
Connections may be interrupted when restarting openvswitch-vswitchd. If this is to be avoided workloads should
be live migrated and the update should by done node by node.</p>

<p>OpenStack allows to attach and detach volumes from running instances.
When a volume is detached from a VM (using the appropriate API call to the
compute service), the compute service (Nova) removes the access to the
volume for the VM and then calls the storage service (Cinder) on the user’s
behalf to force access to be stopped. However, the storage service API
can also be invoked directly by the user. Even if the volume is still
attached, this can be forced and Cinder will not talk to Nova, so it results
in a surprise removal on the compute side. The VM on the compute mode in
this case thus continues to be entitled to access the storage volume,
though this will result in I/O errors due to being rejected by the
storage service.</p>

<p>Due to the way the SCSI and multipath stacks work in Linux, the devices used to
access the storage can be reused. It is thus possible that a newly created
storage volume uses the device that was incompletely revoked before, resulting
in the old VM getting access to the new volume despite not owning it.</p>

<p>In OpenStack setups, this affects storage access via iSCSI and
via FibreChannel.</p>

<p>Authenticated users of the OpenStack IaaS service thus might accidentially
get access to storage volumes that they should not be authorized to.
This can also be provoked by doing lots of force detachments.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2023-2088">CVE-2023-2088</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>In the reference implementation of <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a>,
the storage service is provided by <a href="https://ceph.io/">ceph</a>
and access to the storage is handled through rados block devices, not the
SCSI layer. No problematic reuse of connections/devices/identifiers has been
found for this and the storage isolation is maintained.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/osism/cloud-in-a-box">cloud-in-a-box</a> configurations
before ~R4 this year used iSCSI to access local storage volumes – this has
meanwhile been replaced by a single-node ceph setup. So it is not affected any
more. Note that we don’t consider the cloud-in-a-box setup to be meant for
production, so we would not necessarily provide patches with the same urgency
for it even it it was still affected.</p>

<h2 id="scs-provider-status">SCS provider status</h2>

<p>It is possible for providers to diverge from SCS default setup with ceph storage
and connect other block storage backends that use SCSI and are thus affected
by this. We have double-checked with the four productive public clouds (Betacloud,
pluscloud open, Wavestack, regio.digital cloud) that use SCS currently
and they are not affected.</p>

<h2 id="embargo">Embargo</h2>

<p>The issue has been reported by Jan Wasilewski in private to the OpenStack 
Vulnerability Management Team.
The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address
the issue with fixes and an embargo date
has been set to Wednesday, 2023-05-10, 15:00 UTC. At this point in time, the
patches will get merged and an OpenStack Security Advisory
(<a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2023-003.html">OSSA-2023-003</a>) will
be published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2004555">#2004555</a>, which should be
publically accessible after the advisory has been published.</p>

<p>Under the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with
a select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and
protect their user data in time for the publication.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://scs.community/">SCS</a> and <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a> teams have
analyzed the information carefully and determined that the SCS IaaS reference
implementation from OSISM is not affected in the default configuration.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>To avoid Cinder removing devices that Nova still assumes to have access to,
Cinder should reject force removals of still-attached volumes unless the
removal request comes from Nova. There are patches from the upstream
maintainers that help Cinder to make that distinction. The OpenStack
os-brick library gets support for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force</code> parameter that Nova and
Glance can then use. In addition, 
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/service-token.html">config changes</a>
need to be applied to enable Nova to send service tokens along with
the user tokens and which is then used by Cinder to validate the
provenance of the request.</p>

<p>The next minor release of OSISM (expected end of May / early June) will include
the necessary changes for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force</code> parameter. It is still under investigation
whether the changes to enable service tokens can be safely applied as part of
the automated upgrade process or whether that will be documented as an important
hint for cloud operators that diverge in their storage implementation from
the default setup with ceph (where this is all not needed).</p>

<p>A workaround until the next minor release can be implemented by providers.
It would entail a config change that ensures that Nova uses a user with a
service role to send tokens to Cinder on behalf of users and a policy
on the Cinder API that enforces this role. This is described in more detail
in the <a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2023-003.html">OpenStack Security Advisory</a>.
We suggest providers that use OSISM in modes which may require such
protection to get in touch with us.</p>

<p>David Marchand (RedHat) reported an issue with Open vSwitch (OvS) where
the failure to properly execute ‘set’ actions for specifically crafted
network packets with IP protocol number 0 could lead to a succesful remote
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is long-standing and affects Open vSwitch going back until
at least 1.5.0. (Current is 3.1.1, which has this issue fixed.)</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2023-1668">CVE-2023-1668</a>;
a more detailed description can be found in the 
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/06/1">Openwall OSS security advisory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>Open vSwitch is used in almost all OpenStack setups – specifically all SCS
setups known to us use OvS. This includes both the OVN configurations
(the SCS default) as well as those that rely on OvS alone.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>

<p>It is possible to set flow rules that block IP protocol 0 packets by adding
3 flow rules as highest priority rules to every OvS bridge. Care is needed to
ensure this happens automatically on every single bridge, which is a non-trivial
endeavor.</p>

<p>There are patches available to fix the issue. These patches are included in the
current OvS version 3.1.1. They have also been backported into older versions
3.0.4, 2.17.6, 2.16.7, 2.15.8, 2.14.9, 2.13.11.</p>

<h2 id="scs-releases">SCS releases</h2>

<p>Due to ongoing work on improving the network stack, <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>
had released version <a href="http://release.osism.tech/notes/5.1.0.html">5.1.0</a> on Apr 7,
which includes OvS version 3.1.1 that includes the fix. Due to the networking
improvements, the SCS project had advised all SCS partners to move from OSISM-4.x
(SCS Release 3) or from 5.0.0 (SCS Release 4) to 5.1.0 even without being aware
of CVE-2023-1668.</p>

<p>SCS release 3 (OSISM-4.x) is only officially supported until the end of April
2023 – we advise all our partners to move to R4 with OSISM-5.1.0 or later as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>OSISM has worked on preparing a version 4.3.0 that includes a patched OvS version
for those partners that can not yet move to R4/OSISM-5.x. A release of this is
planned for next week. No further updates are planned after this final release
of R3/OSISM-4.x., users should move to R4/OSISM-5.x.</p>

<h2 id="patch-status-of-scs-clouds">Patch status of SCS clouds</h2>

<p>The networking improvements for OSISM-5.1.0 were done in close alignement between
plusserver and OSISM – unsurprisingly, all regions of the 
<a href="https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open">pluscloud open</a>
had been upgraded to OSISM-5.1.0 in calendar week 15 already.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://betacloud.de/">Betacloud</a> runs the rolling tag (latest) images
and thus has picked up the fixes the day after they became available.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.noris.de/wavestack-cloud/">WaveStack</a> operators are planning
to do the upgrade to R4/OSISM-5.1+ next week. For now, their inbound firewalls
protect them from remote attacks with evil proto 0 packets.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://regio.digital/">regio tech</a> cloud has deployed OSISM-5.1.0 last
week already.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>The authors would like to thank David Marchand who reported the vulnerability,
the upstream OvS community and Jens Harbott at OSISM for working on addressing
the issue.</p>

<p>On 2023-01-25, three vulnerabilities in bind9, a popular DNS server implementation,
were reported. Summarizing the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5827-1">Ubuntu Security Notice</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3094">CVE-2022-3094</a>:
A large number of UPDATE messages can lead to resource exhaustion.
The impact of unauthenticated messages is comparable to normal queries
and thus uncritical; authenticated messages however have a higher
impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3736">CVE-2022-3736</a>:
Specially crafted RRSIG queries can cause bind9 to crash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3924">CVE-2022-3924</a>:
bind9 servers that are configured to respond to queries from stale
cache entries may be caused to crash.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All three vulnerabilities thus allow remote Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks; the first one though only for trusted parties that can send
authenticated UPDATE messages. No information disclosure or privilege
escalation was found.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The Designate service (DNS as a Service in OpenStack) is an optional feature of
the <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> IaaS reference
implementation (by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>). Operators can choose to
expose the used bind9 DNS server to the VMs and the internet directly or
use it to feed a dedicated DNS service.</p>

<p>If the bind9 service is exposed, it could be vulnerable to the DoS attacks.</p>

<p>The operators we work closely with are mostly using the stable version (currently
R3, aka v4.x) of the reference implementation, which comes with OpenStack
Yoga and container images built with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal). They
recently had to upgrade to v4.2.0 to address
<a href="https://scs.community/security/2023/01/24/cve-2022-47951/">CVE-2022-47951</a>.</p>

<p>For Ubuntu 20.04, only CVE-2022-3094 applies. Authenticated UPDATE messages
to bind9 can be generated from a user by manipulating the zone records
in Designate via API calls. In our assessement, we deem it unlikely that
it can be done at a rate that results in a successful DoS. The attacker
would obviously also be identifiable.</p>

<p>Operators using the main development branch of OSISM (which includes
container images with OpenStack Zed based on Ubuntu 22.04) are affected
by all three vulnerabilities if they expose bind9 directly. They
thus may experience successful DoS attacks until they address the issue.</p>

<h2 id="fixes-and-recommendations">Fixes and recommendations</h2>

<p>Package updates from Ubuntu have been released.
Users using it to operate their own DNS service obviously should install
the updates.</p>

<p>SCS operators that use v4.2 don’t need to worry as explained before.
A future build of the images will pick up the fixed bind9 version;
currently no plans exist to trigger a minor release just for the
CVE-2022-3094 fix.</p>

<p>SCS operators that use the main branch should ensure that their update
process works to pick up and deploy the regularly rebuilt container
images from OSISM’s main branch. Update: The currently (as of Fri 2023-01-27
afternoon European time) published images with the rolling tag already
contain the fixed bind9.</p>

<p>Guillaume Espanel, Pierre Libeau, Arnaud Morin and Damien Rannou (OVH) found a
vulnerability in the VMDK image processing code in
<a href="https://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> Cinder (OpenStack’s block storage service),
Glance (image service) and Nova (compute service), which they reported to the
OpenStack security team. The vulnerability allows for crafted flat image files
to reference crafted backing file paths which can result in the
server returning file content with potentially sensitive data. This affects all
Nova and Cinder deployments; it also affects Glance deployments if image
conversion (from VMDK) is enabled.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.report/CVE-2022-47951">CVE-2022-47951</a>.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-scs-reference-implementation">Impact on the SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>While the <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> reference
implementation (by <a href="https://osism.tech/">OSISM</a>) runs these services in
containers and thus protects most files on the Hypervisor from being accessed
using this vulnerability, the containers do have access to sensitive data and
thus has a potential attacker. <em>To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker must
be an authenticated user of the platform.</em></p>

<p>We are able to reproduce this issue on unpatched platforms using the SCS
reference implementation.
We are still determining whether the damage in our setup goes beyond the
disclosure of sensitive information by potentially leaking credentials that
allow for further privilege escalation up to getting admin access to the IaaS
cloud layer and thus access to all unencrypted data of customers of the
affected platform.</p>

<p>In any case, this vulnerability is very severe and operators of OpenStack
platforms are advised to deploy fixed versions as soon as possible.</p>

<p>While disabling image conversion in Glance does protect Glance, there is no
straight-forward mitigation to effectively protect Cinder and Nova, see
below (Mitigation and Fixes).</p>

<h2 id="embargo">Embargo</h2>

<p>The issue has been reported to the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in
private. The reporters and upstream developers have worked together to address
the issue with fixes and an embargo date
has been set to Tuesday, 2023-01-24, 15:00 UTC. At this point in time, the
patches will get merged and the OpenStack Security Advisory
(<a href="https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2023-002.html">OSSA-2023-002</a>) will
be published. The issue is tracked in OpenStack issue
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1996188">#1996188</a>, which should be
publically accessible now, after the advisory has been published.</p>

<p>Under the used responsible disclosure approach, the information was shared with
a select group of trustable users of OpenStack, so they can prepare updates and
protect their user data in time for the publication.</p>

<p>The reference implementation for the IaaS layer of Sovereign Cloud Stack
is provided by the OSISM project – the OSISM team builds the artifacts in a
completely public process. The fixes will thus be applied right after the 
embargo is lifted; this will result in new artifacts within a few hours;
the resulting artifacts (kolla-ansible container images) will be thoroughly
tested using the CI tests and then published with the tag v4.2.0. This is
expected to happen during the day of Wed, 2023-01-25.
Update: The release of <a href="https://github.com/osism/release/tree/main/4.2.0">OSISM v4.2.0</a>
has happened in the evening (european time) of 2023-01-25.</p>

<p>Given the severity of the issue, the SCS and OSISM teams have agreed to
temporarily build patched images for the Cinder, Nova and Glance services in
private and provide them privately to our public cloud providers with an NDA
that disallows to disclose any information prior to the embargo lift time.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fixes">Mitigation and Fixes</h2>

<p>The disablement of conversions of VMDK images does protect the Glance service;
unfortunately both Cinder and Nova also support many different image formats
and they don’t provide a config option to disable handling VMDKs. No
simple mitigation is known to us here.</p>

<p>There are patches from the upstream OpenStack developers available. They work
by analyzing the VMDK images and raising an exception if any options are used
that allow extents that reference other files. Such images will no longer be
accepted and thus can no longer be used to exfiltrate sensitive files.</p>

<p>We are able to confirm that the previously successful attacks are addressed
by the fixes. While offending VMDK images can still be uploaded and stored
in Glance, they will be rejected before they can be converted to raw in
Glance or for usage by Cinder or Nova.</p>

<h2 id="patch-status-of-scs-clouds">Patch status of SCS clouds</h2>

<p>We have been working (under NDA) with operators using the SCS reference
implementation from OSISM to ensure they are prepared for this vulnerability.
We can report that the three publically known providers of SCS IaaS
platforms, <a href="https://betacloud.de/">Betacloud</a> (from OSISM),
<a href="https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud-open">pluscloud open</a>
(from plusserver) and <a href="https://www.noris.de/wavestack-cloud/">WaveStack</a>
(from Wavecon/Noris) have all deployed the privately provided fixed
containers and are thus protected from the reported vulnerability. They
will all move to the published v4.2.0 release in the next few days to
again use the officially supported public code as opposed to the private
hotfixes.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>The authors would like to thank the abovementioned OVH engineers, the upstream
OpenStack developers and the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team for the
responsible reporting, careful analysis, fixing, testing and professional
handling of the issue and the OSISM team for providing the fixed containers.</p>

<p>On Tue, 2022-11-01, two vulnerabilities in the popular OpenSSL library
became publicly known. They affect OpenSSL-3.0.x versions prior
to the fixed version 3.0.7; older versions of OpenSSL (1.1.x
and earlier) are not affected.</p>

<p>There are two vulnerabilities in the X.509 certificate parsing code
for email addresses, CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. Both are described
in the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221101.txt">OpenSSL Security Advisory</a>.
Both can result in buffer overflows which can crash the application,
resulting in a denial-of-service. The possibility to put 4 attacker-controlled
bytes on the stack in CVE-2022-3602 might even result in remote code execution
scenarios, though commonly used stack overflow protections prevent this.
The effectiveness of the stack overflow protections has lead the severity
classification to be downgraded from CRITICAL to HIGH.</p>

<p>A good collection of information on these vulnerabilities can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/NCSC-NL/OpenSSL-2022">Netherlands Cyber Security Centrum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scs-reference-implementation">SCS reference implementation</h2>

<p>The host images in the SCS reference implementation come from the
<a href="https://osism.tech">OSISM</a> project and are all built on top of Ubuntu 20.04
LTS (focal). Ubuntu 20.04 uses OpenSSL-1.1.1 and is unaffected by the
vulnerability. The switch to Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) which does use OpenSSL-3.0.x
is planned for SCS R4 (v5.0.0, due in Mar 2023) and has not happened yet,
neither in the OSISM image build system nor in the one from the upstream kolla
project.</p>

<p>The deployment of SCS happens via deploying numerous infrastructure
and OpenStack services in containers. The OpenStack containers come from
the upstream kolla project which uses Ubuntu 20.04. We are in progress
of reviewing all non-kolla containers to ensure that none of them pull-in
dependencies on OpenSSL-3.</p>

<!--TODO: OSISM to check all containers ...-->
<!--TODO: Add link to SBOM -->

<p>The SCS reference implementation for Kubernetes container management deploys a
management host using Ubuntu 20.04 for bootstrapping and managing the
workload clusters. The workload clusters use node images that are built
by OSISM using Ubuntu 20.04. The contained Kubernetes services do not
pull in OpenSSL-3 either.</p>

<p>The container management solution allows to deploy a number of standard
services. Many of the services are built using the golang programming
language and are thus not using OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Here is the list of services that can be deployed with the SCS cluster-API
container management solution and the openSSL status of these:</p>

<h2 id="rebuilt-containers">Rebuilt containers</h2>

<p>The SCS community is prepared to publish security updates.
For the containerized OSISM base-deployment, this means preparing updated
containers that can be deployed, replacing the old containers.</p>

<p>Preparing for the OpenSSL-3 vulnerability, the OSISM team has prepared
to publish a version v4.1.0 containing all security and important bug fixes
that have been collected since R3 (v4.0.0 on 2022-09-21).</p>

<p>The OpenSSL-3 vulnerability currently does not seem to require such a
point release. However, there is also a go security update currently
happening, suggesting that a point release may well be good idea.
This is currently under investigation – future updates of this
advisory will contain updated information on this.</p>

<h2 id="public-vm-images-on-scs-clouds">Public VM images on SCS clouds</h2>

<p>Most clouds provide public images for popular Linux distributions
as a convenience to their users. Ubuntu 22.04 is one of the images that
SCS recommends providing; <a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3602">it is affected by the OpenSSL-3 issue</a>.
Other modern distributions (e.g. those based on RedHat Enterprise
Linux 9) are also affected; we recommend to use the list at
<a href="https://github.com/NCSC-NL/OpenSSL-2022/blob/main/software/README.md">https://github.com/NCSC-NL/OpenSSL-2022/blob/main/software/README.md</a>
to get a quick overview and to investigate yourself for the more
critical parts of applications. The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl version</code>
can be used to learn about the installed OpenSSL version.</p>

<p>We recommend to SCS operators to quickly replace the affected public images
as soon as the Linux distributors have provided updated base images.
Note that SCS has defined
<a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata.md">metadata</a>
for images that allow users to see the build date. Any image that is older than
2022-11-01 and includes OpenSSL-3.0.x will very likely be vulnerable.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-applications">Fixing applications</h2>

<p>Affected VM-based applications that are dynamically linked against OpenSSL and
use automation for bootstrapping may best just redeploy against the latest
images to use the fixed OpenSSL version. Otherwise an online update of the
OpenSSL-3 library is recommended. Note that applications need to be restarted
to use the updated fixed shared library. Applications that statically linked
the vulnerable OpenSSL-3.0.x (x&lt;7) library need to be rebuilt using the fixed
library (3.0.7 or later).</p>

<p>For container-based applications that built containers using affected
OpenSSL-3 libraries, rebuilding the containers with the fixed version
and redeploying them is recommended.</p>

<p>Sidenote:
We also remind users to review the workstations and laptops that are
used by their staff and to install available updates short-term.</p>
