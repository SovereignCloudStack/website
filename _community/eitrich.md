bio: |
  Eduard is an open source community manager currently empowering the Sovereign Cloud Stack community at the OSB Alliance (Open Source Business Alliance). After graduating from university, he was part of a software development team and responsible for the release management of a Linux enterprise distribution. Following up his two-year parental leave, during which he orchestrated his twin daughters rather than continuous deployment pipelines, he became the head of digitalization and IT of the medium-sized town B체hl in southwestern Germany.
