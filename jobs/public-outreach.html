<meta name="description" content="Public Outreach Manager (f/m/d) (Remote or Berlin-Centre) The position is to be filled at the earliest possible date. About the project The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the association is committed to anchoring the central importance of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public consciousness. The OSB Alliance considers open source and open standards to be essential foundations for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the digital transformation and therefore the answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time. With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is helping to realise the goals of the German government’s “Digital Strategy Germany” and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud infrastructure. The project is being driven forward by a small team in the OSB Alliance with funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team, there are numerous developers from various companies and institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by the project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS successful. The SCS project defines and implements a complete, modular, secure and open-source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack meets high security standards and comes with tools and documentation that reduce the need for specialised expertise to operate complex cloud and container infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative development, documentation and open provision of operational knowledge (“Open Operations”) is a key building block that is intended to simplify the operation of complex cloud infrastructures at the highest level. SCS can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and deployed as a whole or in subcomponents depending on specific requirements. The components can be certified automatically, which ensures compatibility with other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of federable, compatible clouds. SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X endeavour by serving as a reference for development work and providing implementations that node providers can use in whole or in part to create a federated, sovereign infrastructure that forms the basis for a sovereign data ecosystem. About the role As a Public Outreach Manager you will as a member of the SCS project team, contribute to the communication of project results and successes to the general public, Improve the visibility and understanding of SCS among the general public, Participate in the definition of target groups and contribute to the (further) development of the communication strategy, develop and disseminate print and online communication material, organise the SCS Summit 2024 on your own responsibility, ensure the sustainable, publicly accessible documentation of the 2023 and 2024 Summit results. We expect that you have a relevant university degree (Bachelor’s or Master’s) or equivalent skills and experience, have several years of experience in event organisation and communication as well as in the creation of relevant materials ideally have experience in communicating IT topics, have strong organisational and communication skills, can formulate technically complex content in a generally understandable and appealing way, have initiative and are resilient and flexible, can develop concepts, critically review them in a team and implement them, have a very good command of written and spoken German and a good command of written and spoken English, enjoy working in a self-organised team, enjoy open source and working for the common good. We offer a job in an open and inspiring environment where you can work with highly qualified and committed people from the project, partners and the relevant open source communities worldwide, the opportunity to contribute to a project that aims to be a key contributor to a vibrant ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond, exciting, cutting-edge technological and socially relevant topics, a lot of flexibility in how you can organise your work and contribute to the internationally distributed team. This is a full-time position; however, part-time is not excluded. an appropriate salary.

    <h1 id="public-outreach-manager-fmd">Public Outreach Manager (f/m/d)</h1>
<p>(Remote or Berlin-Centre)</p>

<p>The position is to be filled at the earliest possible date.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

<p>The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open
source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually in
Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the
association is committed to anchoring the central importance of open source
software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public
consciousness. The OSB Alliance considers open source and open standards to be
essential foundations for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the
digital transformation and therefore the answer to one of the greatest
challenges of our time.</p>

<p>With the  Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is helping to
realise the goals of the German government’s “Digital Strategy Germany” and the
European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The project is being driven forward by a small team in the OSB Alliance with
funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
(BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to
this team, there are numerous developers from various companies and
institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by the
project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS
successful.</p>

<p>The SCS project defines and implements a complete, modular, secure and
open-source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack meets
high security standards and comes with tools and documentation that reduce the
need for specialised expertise to operate complex cloud and container
infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative development, documentation and
open provision of operational knowledge (“Open Operations”) is a key building
block that is intended to simplify the operation of complex cloud
infrastructures at the highest level.</p>

<p>SCS can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and
deployed as a whole or in subcomponents depending on specific requirements. The
components can be certified automatically, which ensures compatibility with
other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of federable,
compatible clouds.</p>

<p>SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X endeavour by serving as a reference for
development work and providing implementations that node providers can use in
whole or in part to create a federated, sovereign infrastructure that forms the
basis for a sovereign data ecosystem.</p>
