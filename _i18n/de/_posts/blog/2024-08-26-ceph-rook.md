## Ceph deployment with Rook

Because ceph-ansible is [deprecated](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/commit/a9d1ec844d24fcc3ddea7c030eff4cd6c414d23d), SCS now implements ceph-deployment with [rook](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Getting-Started/intro/), a [graduated-level cloud-native project](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/).
