## Ceph deployment with Rook

Because ceph-ansible is [deprecated](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/commit/a9d1ec844d24fcc3ddea7c030eff4cd6c414d23d), SCS now implements ceph-deployment with [rook](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Getting-Started/intro/), a [graduated-level cloud-native project](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/).

## OSISM reference implementation

Within OSISM rook is now deployed with the officially recommended and provided [helm-charts](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Helm-Charts/helm-charts/). Ansible is used to deploy the helm-charts for both the [rook-operator](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/tree/main/roles/rook_operator) and the [rook-crd](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/tree/main/roles/rook).

It has also been integrated into the testbed. To see the various osism commands related to rook simply type `osism apply`:

```
dragon@testbed-manager:/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy$ osism apply | grep rook
| rook                                                             | rook           |
| rook-cleanup                                                     | rook           |
| rook-crd                                                         | rook           |
| rook-fetch-keys                                                  | rook           |
| rook-helm                                                        | rook           |
| rook-operator                                                    | rook           |
```

A minimal working rook can be installed by using the helper script in `/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-rook-services.sh`, which automates the installation of [k3s]() then runs this:

```
osism apply rook-operator
osism apply rook
osism apply rook-fetch-keys

# the role for the cephclient is informed which type of client should be installed. 
echo "cephclient_install_type: rook" >> /opt/configuration/environments/infrastructure/configuration.yml
osism apply cephclient
```

Note: the cephclient for OSISM is setup to be configured for rook. It is a small role that makes sure that only the client for rook is setup.

## Configuration

It is possible to confiure rook, i.e. the variables for the helm-chart, by editing the file `environments/rook/configuration.yml`. For the various options see the [configration guide of scs](https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/guides/configuration-guide/rook)
The OSISM testbed offers the following default configuration in `/opt/configuration/environments/rook/config.yml` on the manager node:
