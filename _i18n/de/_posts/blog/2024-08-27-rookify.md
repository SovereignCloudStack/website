## Migrating from Ceph-Ansible to Rook with Rookify

To facilitate the transition from Ceph-Ansible to Rook, SCS has almost finished developing a migration tool called [Rookify](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify). This tool simplifies and streamlines the migration process, making it easier for users to switch from a Ceph-Ansible deployment to Rook. The tool is now under first technical preview and is being tested.

### Features and Design

#### Statemachine

Rookify is a python package that uses a **state-machine approach** based on the [transitions-library](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) to migrate the various resources such as mons, mgrs, osds, mds and anything else, to Rook. Each of these resources has a corresponding [module](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/tree/main/src/rookify/modules) in Rookify, which can be executed  independently or in combination with other modules.

Itâ€™s important to note that most modules have dependencies on other modules and will implicitly run them as needed. For example, the `mgirate-mons`-module needs the `analyze-ceph` module to run first (as indicated by the [REQUIRES variable]((https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/blob/main/src/rookify/modules/migrate_monitors/main.py))).This is necessary for Rookify to determine the current location of the mons and where they should be migrated to.

Rookify can be configured by editing a comprehensive `config.yml` file, such as the provided [confing.example.yaml](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/blob/main/config.example.yaml). This configuration file specifies various configuration-dependencies (like SSH keys, Kubernetes and Ceph configurations) and allows users to easily decide which modules should be run (see the `migration_modules` section below). 

#### A simple CLI and Pickle support

Rookify optionally (and recommended) supports using a **pickle-file** (see on top below the `general` section in config.example.yaml). [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) is a modle for object serialization that saves the state of progress externally, i.e. which modules have been run and infomrmation about the target machine. New features are currently in development to enhance the existing CLI interface, allowing it to read the pickle file and use Rookify's modules to report the exact state of the migration process. This means that Rookify can continue from where a discontinued or partially failed migration left off.

Currently, Rookify only offers a straightforward CLI interface:

```
usage: Rookify [-h] [--dry-run]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --dry-run
```

#### Rookify's workflow: how does it get the job done?

Rookify's main function is to migrate all of Ceph's resources to Rook. Let's take a look at the migration_modules section in the config.yml file:

```
migration_modules:
- migrate_mons
```

This configuration instructs Rookify to perform the following steps:

1. Preflight Mode: The migrate_mons module first runs in a preflight mode, which can also be manually triggered using the rookify --dry-run command. During this phase, Rookify checks the execution state from the pickle file. If the migration has already been successfully completed, the module stops here.

The `analyze-ceph` module collects data the running Cephs resources and of kubernetes with the running rook-operator. It optionally saves the finding in a pickle-file. The `analyze-ceph` module will also first run in `preflight`-mode and check if state has already been captured in the pickle file: if there is no state, then `ceph-analyze` will striphe to gather the needed information.

2. Dependency Check: If the migrate_mons module has not been run before (indicated by an empty pickle file), Rookify checks for dependencies, e.g. other modules that need to be run first. It execute those modules, first in preflight mode and then for real. The state of each module will optionally be saved in the pickle file.

2.1 `ceph-analyze` module: Rookify identifies that the `analyze-ceph` module needs to be run first in any case. The `analyze-ceph` module collects data on the running Ceph resources and the Kubernetes environment with the Rook operator. Note that, like any other module, `ceph-analyze` first runs in preflight mode to check if the state has already been captured in the pickle file. If no state is found, `analyze-ceph` gathers the necessary information.

2.1 Cluster Creation: After successfully running the analyze-ceph` module, Rookify will check for other dependencies, such as the `create-cluster` module. This module creates the cluster map for Rook based on information from `analyze-ceph` and sets up the necessary namespaces in Kubernetes.

3. Migration Execution: Following the successful execution of `analyze_ceph` and `create_cluster`, the `migrate_mons`-module is executed. Rookify shuts down the first running Ceph monitor on the first worker node using `sudo systemctl disable --now ceph-mon.target` and immediately activates the equivalent monitor in Rook by setting its metadata in the clustermap.yaml to true.

5. Monitor Migration: Rookify continues this process for each monitor until all have been migrated to Rook and are running. Optionally, the state can be saved in the pickle file.

Depending on what resources you want to migrate, rookify will use a similar approach: it will try to switch of the ceph resource after it has made sure that it can re-create an equivalent in the rook cluster.

## Test run: Give it a try and help with testing process

To get started with Rookify, make sure to checkout the [README.md](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/blob/main/README.md) in the repository.

If you'd like to try to test the current state of Rookify (much apprciated - feel free to report any [issues](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify/issues) to Github), you can use the testbed of OSISM. 

### Testbed setup

_NOTE_: The OSISM testbed is intended for testing purposes, which means it may be unstable. If Ceph and K3s cannot be deployed without errors, you may need to wait for a fix or find a workaround to test Rookify. (For example, OSISM also offers a more stable testing setup called "[Cloud in a box](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/other-guides/cloud-in-a-box/)." I will provide more details on this in a future blog post.)

In order to setup the testbed, first consult [OSISM's testbed documentation](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed)  to ensure you meet all requirements. If everything is in order, clone the repository and use make ceph to set up a Ceph testbed. This command will automatically pull the necessary Ansible roles, prepare a virtual environment, build the infrastructure with OpenStack, create a manager node, and deploy Ceph on three worker nodes:

```bash
git clone github.com:osism/testbed.git
make ceph
```

Once the infrastructure for Ceph and the testbed has been deployed, log in with make login and deploy K3s as well as a Rook operator:

```bash
make login 
osism apply k3s
osism apply rook-operator
```

If you want to modify any configurations, such as a Rook setting, refer to `/opt/configuration/environments/rook/` and check [OSISM's documentation on Rook](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/configuration-guide/rook) for various settings.

## Rookify Setup/Configuration for OSISM's Testbed

1. **Clone the Rookify Repository**: Start by cloning the Rookify repository, setting it up, and building the Python package in a virtual environment using the Makefile. You can simply run make without any arguments to see a list of helper functions that can assist you in setting up and configuring Rookify. The command make setup downloads the necessary virtual environment libraries and installs the Rookify package into .venv/bin/rookify within the working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/rookify
cd rookify
make setup
```

_NOTE_: If you encounter an error about the absence of the python-rados library, you can run check-radoslib to check if the library is installed locally. If not, install the package manually. The python-rados library should be version 2.0.0 at the time of writing (check the README.md file of Rookify for the most up-to-date documentation). The library could not be integrated within the setup because Ceph currently offers no builds for pip.

2. **Configure Rookify**: Copy config.example.osism.yml to config.yml and modify the various configuration settings as needed. Rookify will require access to an SSH key (e.g., the .id_rsa file in the Terraform directory in the testbed repository), Ceph configuration files (see /etc/ceph/ on one of the worker nodes), and Kubernetes files (e.g., ~/.kube/config from the manager node). Check if the Makefile contains any helper functions to assist you: run make in the root of the working directory to see all options that the Makefile offers.

_Important_: Ensure that Rookify can connect to the testbed. To do this, use one of the testbed's built-in VPNs:

```
# you can use sshuttle
make vpn-sshuttle
# Or you can use WireGuard (requires running `make vpn-wireguard-config` first)
make vpn-wireguard
```

3. **Run Rookify**: Finally, run Rookify to test it. Rookify allows the use of `--dry-run` to run modules in preflight mode. Note that Rookify always runs the various modules in preflight mode first before actually executing them. It is safe to run the `example` or `analyze_ceph` modules, as these will not make any real changes.

```yaml

migration_modules: # this sets the modules that need to be run. Note that some of the modules require other modules to be run as well, this will happen automatically.
- analyze_ceph
```

If everything is set up correctly, you can run Rookify without any arguments:

```bash
.venv/bin/rookify --dry-run
# or simply
.venv/bin/rookify # the analyze_ceph module is not expected to break anything
```

If all is setup correctly you might see an output similar to this:

```bash

```
