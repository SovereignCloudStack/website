### SCS Summits

The [2023 SCS Summit](/summit2023) was a big success, so we are planning the
[2024 SCS Summit](/summit2024) now for May 14, 2024 in Berlin.
The event will be primarily focused on policy makers and decision takers
in the industry again and will be primarily held in German language.
The next day, in the same location, we are co-organizing the
[Open Infra Day](https://openstack.org/events/openstackdays#tab=events_tab),
a much more technical event, with primarily English lanuage content.
