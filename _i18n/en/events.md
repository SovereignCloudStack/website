### SCS Summits

After [last year's great success](/summit2023), the next [SCS Summit
2024](/summit2024) will take place again in Berlin on May 14, 2024. We will
publish further information about the program and the venue on the event page
shortly. As last year, the summit will again be largely in German, focused on
decision makers from politics and business. On the following day, the [Open
Infra Day Germany](https://openinfra.dev/days#tab=events_tab) will take place
at the same venue, with primarily English language content and a more
technical focus.
