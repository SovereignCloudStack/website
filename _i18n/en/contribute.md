# Contribute to Sovereign Cloud Stack

Sovereign Cloud Stack is an open community of providers and end-users joining forces
in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform.
We actively encourage you to contribute either code, documentation or issues and to
participate in the various discussions happening on GitHub or during our various meetings.

The best entry point to understand how we work as a community and how you can contribute
is the [Community section on our docs pages](https://docs.scs.community/community/).

## We're on GitHub

We're actively developing, discussing and planning on [GitHub](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack).
The technical teams are using a joint [project board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6)
to plan and monitor the progress during our sprints. 

## We're  an open community

Our meetings are publicly announced and we are happy to welcome both newcomers and
established members alike. You can navigate either through the calendar below or
subscribe with your favorite client to `https://sovereigncloudstack.github.io/calendar/scs.ics`.
The calendar is collaboratively maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/calendar)
and new entries, such as a lightning talk, are highly appreciated!

## We're chatty

We have created an [open community space on the Matrix network](https://matrix.to/#/!TiDqlLmEUaXqTemaLc:matrix.org?via=matrix.org). Feel free to join the several channels
and start interacting with the community. A good starting point is entering the
[General & Announcements](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-general:matrix.org) and the
[Tech](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-tech:matrix.org) channel.

## We're a global community

We are a global community of companies and organizations. If you want to join forces,
don't hesitate to contact us at [project[at]scs.sovereignit.de](mailto:project@scs.sovereignit.de).
Our core team is looking forward to meeting you and getting you on board!
