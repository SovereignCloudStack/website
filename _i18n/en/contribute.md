# Contribute to Sovereign Cloud Stack

Sovereign Cloud Stack is an open community of providers and end-users joining forces
in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform.
We actively encourage you to contribute either code, documentation or issues and to
participate in the various discussions happening on GitHub or during our various meetings.

The best entry point to understand how we work as a community and how you can contribute
is the [Community section on our docs pages](https://docs.scs.community/community/).

## We're a global community

We are a global community of companies and organizations. If you want to join forces,
don't hesitate to contact us at [project[at]scs.sovereignit.de](mailto:project@scs.sovereignit.de).
Our core team is looking forward to meeting you and getting you on board!
