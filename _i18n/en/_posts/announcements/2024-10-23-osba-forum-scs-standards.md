## OSBA and members found the forum SCS-Standards

*Berlin, 2024-10-23: Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) provides all
cloud-technological foundations to realize digital sovereignty and
open source strategies and gives users control over their data.
The research project, funded by the German Ministry for
Economy and Climate Action and located at the Open Source Business
Alliance (OSBA), will be concluded as planned on 2024-12-31.
The OSBA and 14 member companies have taken care to ensure a 
sustainable future for the key results and to further advance the
SCS standards.*

The Sovereign Cloud Stack, funded with roughly 13.2 million Euros,
will receive professional development and be available for the cloud
market after the project phase. The OSBA and 14 of its member companies
are founding the forum SCS-standards effective 2025-01-01. This
consortium inside the OSBA takes responsibility for the standards
and certifications and their further evolution in the future.
This also ensures the quality assurance in a sustainable manner.
All users of Sovereign Cloud Stack and the whole ecosystem around
SCS can thus have assurance of relying on a future-proof cloud
technology.

<blockquote>
"SCS embodies quality, transparency and interoperability in the IT industry.
The core topics of standardization and certification are continued in the
newly founding forum SCS-Standards to protect these values." explains
Peter Ganten, chairman of the OSBA.
</blockquote>

## 14 strong partners engage

<blockquote>
"SCS needs to be advanced even without public subsidies. If we manage to
improve the market conditions and create offerings from various
cloud service providers that are interoperable and federatable thanks
to common standards, this will have beneficial effects on the German and
European cloud economy overall and will lead to long-term success.
This is the reason for our members to invest time and money." comments
Marius Feldmann, COO of Cloud&Heat, chairman of ALASCA e.V. and one of
the two interim chairs of the forum.
</blockquote>

Up to now, 14 companies have collected an annual budget of 257,000 Euros.
Their engagement goes beyond the financial support: They are supporting
the SCS ideas and the common standards. The founding members thus far
are (in alphabetical order):

*   artcodix GmbH
*   B1-Systems GmbH
*   Cloud&Heat Technologies GmbH
*   Dataport AöR
*   dNation, s.r.o.
*   OSISM GmbH
*   plusserver GmbH
*   ScaleUp Technologies GmbH & Co. KG
*   secunet Security Networks AG
*   STACKXPERTS GmbH
*   SysEleven GmbH
*   Syself GmbH
*   Wavecon GmbH
*   Yorizon GmbH

The founding members of the forum SCS-Standards are members of the OSBA.
Further companies can support the forum as shaping, consulting or
supporting member. The memberships fees depends on the membership level
as well as the company's' financial turnover.

The founding members already started to collaborate intensively, two and
a half months ahead of the official establishment. The founding members
include cloud service providers, data center operators, integrators,
developers, security and training specialists.

<blockquote>
"Our aspiration is to take over the results around the topic SCS standards
from the SCS project on 2025-01-01 and be set up to be fully operational then.
We want to process SCS certifications and award companies in 2025 that are
able to fulfill the demanding requirements from the SCS-Standards." explains
Ralph Dehner of B1 Systems, co-chair of the forum.
</blockquote>

## Collaboration on Standardization strengthens the market

<blockquote>
"The non-profit approach, the openness of the standards and the fair
access for all market players is strongly anchored by founding the
forum SCS-Standards within the OSBA by the engaged founding members.
This is a substantial contribution to digital sovereignty in Germany
and Europe." comments Peter Ganten, chairman of the OSBA, and expresses
his gratitude to the involved companies.
</blockquote>

The forum SCS-Standards is open for further members.

### About the Sovereign Cloud Stack project

SCS is being funded by the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
(BMWK) since July 2021 and is run by the Open Source Business Alliance e.V.
A growing international ecosystem of meanwhile more than 25 companies
contributes to its success with more than 50 software developers,
collaborating with thousands of developers in the upstream communities
around the OpenInfra Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation and
others. There also exists a partnership with ALASCA e.V.. An open development
process is used to jointly define open standards for a modern, federatable
open source cloud and container platform. Proven open source components
are used to implement them in production-grade software. In addition,
operation knowledge and processes are made transparent to overcome the
challenges of providing a highly reliable and secure cloud service to
a high degree. The SCS technology is already used by six public cloud
providers in production to provide of truly sovereign and GDPR compliant
cloud offerings. More setups -- both public and private clouds -- are
built. SCS also contributes to Gaia-X and delivers the development platform
for the Gaia-X Federation Services / Cross-Federation Service Components
(GXFS/XFSC).
