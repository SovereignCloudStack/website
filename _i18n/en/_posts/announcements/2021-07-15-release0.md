With great pleasure, we announce the Release 0 of Sovereign Cloud Stack.

While we officially only got the funding for our project a few days ago, we
have already been able to do very useful work with the community that we were
able to set up and which engaged in collaboratively developing software.

R0 is the culmination of more than a year of work, all of which can be found on
github. [SCS](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/) heavily relies on 
[OSISM](https://github.com/OSISM/), so we actually are building on top of
many years of work there. A lot of the SCS work got integrated back into it.
SCS and OSISM of course build on top of thousands of person years
of upstream communities' work. We are standing on the shoulders of giants.

We are really proud with what we achieved with our volunteer community!  The
automation for the lifecycle management of the (containerized) base
infrastructure, the operations tooling, IAM and the IaaS layer is rock solid.
The first two partners, [betacloud](https://betacloud.de) and 
[PlusServer](https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud) are already
using this for their productive clouds and more are in the pipeline.
We have been monitoring the demonstrator (gx-scs) environment from PlusCloudOpen
with [openstack-health-monitor](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor)
and have seen only one slowliness warning in weeks and not a single alarm.
This is no small feat.

Thanks to anyone who contributed to this nice release!

R0 focuses on [testbed](https://docs.osism.tech/testbed/) deployments -- we
want to make it easy for anyone to use SCS for testing, inspection,
contribution, comparison, inspiration, ... at this stage. This in no way should
discourage anyone from a production deployment on bare metal -- as mentioned we
have two cloud providers already using it. Exploring testbed is typically the
first stage though. Get in touch with us if you have made yourself familiar
with SCS via testbed already and want to move to the next stage.

We have updated a lot of documents in the last days. Use our
[github Docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/) as entry point. 
There are specific
[release notes for R0](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Release-Notes/Release0.md).
You can of course also find this from the ["Get SCS"]({{ site.baseurl }}/get)
page from our [web site]({{ site.baseurl }}).

The documents explain how to perform a testbed installation and also how to use
the Technical Preview pieces such as the Kubernetes aaS pieces using the
[k8s-cluster-api](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider).
This will be one of the focus areas for R1 which we already
plan for September. (Note: We'll have a 6 month release cycle going forward,
though the reality is more continuous than this sounds.)

Let us know if you have questions or feedback. We like github issues and PRs,
but will try to followup on [email](mailto:project@scs.sovereignit.de) as well.
