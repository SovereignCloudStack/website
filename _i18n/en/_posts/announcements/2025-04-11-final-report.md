## Successful completion of the funded Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project

Next to a project sketch, lots of forms and the already public articles
and documentation, a funded project also requires a final report.
The format of it is predefined and parts 1 and 2 are meant for publication.
To that end, they have been handed in at the Technical Information Library
(TIB) of the Leibniz Institute in Hanover on 2025-03-24.

To make these documents more easily accessible to our community, we are
publishing the report here as well, hoping that other projects can
benefit from the gained experience in the technical domain, but particularly
also in the way we have approached the processes and structure of the
funded project.

## Final report

The report consists of many tables and forms and multiple pieces of text.
We are publishing the following parts:

<ul>
<li><a href="{% asset 'documents/01_Schlussbericht-Teil1.pdf' @path %}">Part 1: Cover sheet and Short report (2p.)</a></li>
<li><a href="{% asset 'documents/02_Schlussbericht-Teil2.pdf' @path %}">Part 2: Result measurement (20p.)</a></li>
<li><a href="{% asset 'documents/05_Anlage_zur_Liste-Veroeffentlichungen.pdf' @path %}">Appendix to part 2: Publication list</a></li>
</ul>

Please note that the report is available in German language only.

## And on we go

The continuation of SCS is based on two pillars.

The first pillar is the evolution of the SCS standards, the development of
compliance tests, certifications and the dissemination and adoption of the
standards. This is driven by a group inside the
[OSBA](https://osb-alliance.de), the *Forum SCS-Standards*.
For this, the OSBA has created positions for employees to ensure there is meaningful
progress. To fund it, 14 founding companies (meanwhile 17) are paying an extra
membership fee. The standardization governance has been placed inside a
non-profit organization on purpose, ensuring neutrality. This continues to
happen in close collaboration with [ALASCA e.V](https://alasca.cloud/).
More information is available in a [press release on the Forum SCS-Standards](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org/announcements/osba-forum-scs-standards/).

The other pillar is the continuation of the software engineering work on
the SCS Software (reference implementation). Beyond volunteers, this is primarily
driven by technology companies who have invested into SCS already during the
funded project phase. They are expanding their open source business models
and fund the open source software development through commercial service offers
(such as e.g. subscriptions for maintenance and support but also consulting
or training offers). One visible result of the evolution is the
[Release 8 of the SCS reference implementation](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org/announcements/release8/).
Thanks to the existing usage of SCS, this is standing on solid ground.
Also, new companies have emerged and are of course welcome.
To deliver on the aspiration to create a large platform for Europe,
a lot more growth of the network is desirable.
