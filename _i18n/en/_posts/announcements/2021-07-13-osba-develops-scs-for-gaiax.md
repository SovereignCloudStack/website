Stuttgart / Berlin, July 13, 2021 ‒ Companies, citizens and the state are often
forced to store and process very sensitive data in clouds whose functionality
they cannot check or adapt to their needs. This results in a loss of control
and strong technological dependencies on individual, large providers. With the
Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS), the Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance)
is now developing the technical underpinning for Gaia-X to enable complete
digital sovereignty.

The SCS project was initiated in November 2019 by OSB Alliance CEO Peter
Ganten, a leading cloud architect Kurt Garloff, the Director of the German
Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation, Rafael Laguna de la Vera and former
plusserver CEO Dr. Oliver Mauss. The project was initially evaluated with
funding by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation SPRIND and is
now receiving 14.9M€ of federal funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy (BMWi) to develop and build the Sovereign Cloud Stack.

To this end, the Open Source Business Alliance is building a growing team that
will manage and coordinate standardisation, software integration and the
development of the network. A community of employees from participating and
interested companies has already been formed around this team, who are working
in particular on the goals that are important for their own environments.
Important building blocks will also be awarded to companies through open
tenders. In addition, the OSB Alliance will build and operate its own test,
demo and development platform. 

Participation in SCS is not limited to members of the OSB Alliance. This is
because only a multitude of providers within and outside the OSB Alliance will
allow the industry to use modern and agile IT infrastructures without the
strategic, economic and legal risks of using hyperscaler services from the USA
and China. SCS components and standards will enable development teams to
achieve the flexibility, speed and ultimately productivity that is rightly
expected from modern IT infrastructure.

*Peter Ganten, Chairman of the OSB Alliance and Managing Director of Univention:*

> At the heart of the first wave of digitalisation were centralised platforms
> with serious negative consequences for data security, innovation capability and
> the independence of their users. The Sovereign Cloud Stack project makes a
> decisive contribution as a basis for the second wave of digitalisation that is
> now following, with open, federatable technologies that can be deployed without
> requiring permission by 3rd parties. User organisations can thus freely switch
> between providers or also decide to produce parts of their IT infrastructure
> and services under their own control. This creates an open platform for
> innovative applications and services that enables competition, promotes
> innovation and does not have problems like the Cloud Act.

*Thomas Jarzombek (Member of the Bundestag), BMWi representative for the digital economy and start-ups:*

> With the Sovereign Cloud Stack, the GAIA-X project is increasingly being
> filled with life. As a contribution to European digital sovereignty, the
> technical foundation, the Cloud Stack, is to be implemented as an open source
> project in order to enable switching providers in the future. It will make it
> easier for medium-sized companies, but also for public administrations, to use
> the advantages of GAIA-X in specific projects. The Sovereign Cloud Stack will
> be closely linked to the core components of GAIA-X, the so-called Federation
> Services, the creation of which is also funded by the BMWi and is well
> advanced. Together with other funding measures such as the GAIA-X funding
> competition or for future investments in the vehicle industry (KoPa35c), the
> BMWi is lending considerable momentum to the implementation of GAIA-X.

*Kurt Garloff, Project Lead SCS:*

> We actually have all the building blocks for a powerful cloud and container
> stack available as open source software in reasonable quality. But assembling
> them consistently and ensuring the quality and security of the resulting
> infrastructure with continuous test processes is a lot of work that requires a
> large amount of specialised knowledge. And then comes the bigger half of the
> work: the platforms have to be secured in operation by automation and mature
> processes. Integration, continuous testing, operational automation and the
> development of operational processes are carried out independently of each
> other in many companies and cloud providers today. With SCS, we are networking
> these efforts with the goal of avoiding a large amount of work being done in
> isolation or in parallel. In addition to collaborating in Open Source software
> development, we are also establishing cooperation in operations, which we call
> Open Operations. As a result, we achieve a much more powerful stack with higher
> quality and higher standardisation. The latter is especially important for
> users who run applications on multiple clouds or rely on a mix of self-operated
> SCS clouds and public SCS offerings.

*Rafael Laguna de la Vera, Director of the German Federal Agency for Disruptive
Innovation (SPRIND):*

> The Sovereign Cloud Stack is an excellent example of how government
> intervention can fix a market that no longer works. This is because although
> the dominant cloud providers from the US all predominantly use open source
> software in their proprietary cloud stacks, there is no fair competition today
> because switching between different providers is burdensome and expensive. SCS
> removes the 'vendor lock-in' and ensures that smaller providers with innovative
> solutions also have a chance.

*Alexander Wallner, CEO, plusserver:*

> With the Sovereign Cloud Stack, we are bundling the strengths of many open
> source projects to create a powerful and holistic cloud stack. In this way we
> are creating a technology platform that will hopefully quickly become a new
> cloud standard. For cloud providers such as plusserver, the SCS is an important
> component for technological and economic independence. For companies and other
> users, the SCS ensures that they can move their services freely between the
> platforms of different providers. This is how we promote competition in the
> European cloud market.

*Marius Feldmann, COO, Cloud&Heat Technologies GmbH:*

> Sovereign Cloud Stack delivers a significant contribution to avoid European
> Cloud Providers to annihilate each other in fighting, but instead allows them
> to join forces in cooperation. We hope for an ecosystem that develops and
> operates cloud offerings together. As provider of sustainable and secure
> digital infrastructure, we currently face the challenge of creating a highly
> scalable operations model for our technology stack. To cooperatively include
> the competence of other operators, we need a cloud platform with common
> technological and operational standards, which is developed as part of the SCS
> project.

### About the Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance) 

The Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance) is the association of the open
source industry in Germany. We represent over 170 member companies that employ
approximately 10,000 people and generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually
in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, we
are committed to sustainably anchoring the central importance of open source
software and open standards for a successful digital transformation in the
public awareness. This digital transformation should benefit companies, the
state and society alike. In addition, innovations in the field of open source
should be promoted. Our goal is to establish open source as the standard in
public procurement and in research and business promotion. After all, open
source and open standards are essential foundations for digital sovereignty,
innovative capacity and security in the digital transformation and thus the
answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time.
