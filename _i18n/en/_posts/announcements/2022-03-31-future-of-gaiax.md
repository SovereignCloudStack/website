Recent news on the lack of funding for five more German Gaia-X projects has
contributed to public uncertainty about the future of the pan-European
[Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu) project.

[Gaia-X Federation Services (GXFS)](https://gxfs.de/) and 
[Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/)
are the fundamental projects for building the Gaia-X
infrastructure and both projects are not affected by the recent budget cuts,
but continue with full energy. In addition to these two basic projects,
additional projects were earmarked that are intended to apply the recently
developed infrastructure and data ecosystems and create concrete benefits for
the business sector and the public sector.

In a funding competition, 16 projects were selected from very many submissions.
As far as we know, the first 11 are not affected by the budget cuts, but the
other 5 are. In all these projects Gaia-X is intended to become usable and
visible in very concrete application scenarios. For 5 of the selected projects
this will not happen now, which is very regrettable. From our point of view,
however, this does not call Gaia-X into question and the mission to achieve
true digital sovereignty is not abandoned.

<p markdown="1">We also regret the lack of funding for the [Sovereign Tech
Fund](https://sovereigntechfund.de/) and for the German [Zentrum für Digitale
Souveränität](https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Innovative-Vorhaben/ZenDiS/zendis_node.html),
which are important contributions to strengthen open source and its use in
public administration and thus to advance digital sovereignty in a very
practical way. Both initiatives have already been researched and prepared and
were waiting to get kicked off.</p>

Unfortunately, the overall impression is that the positive statements on
digitalisation and the strategy regarding digital sovereignty are
insufficiently followed by deeds. The consequences are unfortunately bitter:
some of the tender plants that appear suitable for advancing digitalisation in
public administration and shaping this in a sovereign manner with the help of
open source approaches would thus unfortunately wither before they could grow.
This is neither good for digitalisation nor for sovereignty.

The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. has also published an [open letter](https://osb-alliance.de/featured/offener-brief-digitale-souveraenitaet-im-bundeshaushalt-2022-beruecksichtigen)
on this.
