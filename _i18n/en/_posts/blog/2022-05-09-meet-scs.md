## OpenInfra Summit Berlin 2022

In June the [OpenInfra Summit](https://openinfra.dev/summit) will be held from 7th to 9th in Berlin at the bcc Berlin Congress Center.
The agenda features loads of interesting talks, among them quite a few from our community.

* Digital sovereignty: Why open infrastructure matters
* An Open Operations concept
* How to create beautiful cloud-native landscapes?
* Intent-based holistic data center management
* Observability in OpenStack: - Learnings and building blocks from the SIG Monitoring at SCS

Furthermore there are going to be a few BoF-sessions as part of the OpenInfra Forum happening at the summit that
got sparked by discussions in our community. It would be great to see you in Berlin!
