We had quite a few sunny days in the southwest of Germany and my mini PV system was running at full load. Reason enough to think about where to put the excess energy, I decided to have yet another look at current state of the *Cloud in a box* image that is provided by [OSISM](https://osism.tech/en).

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:75%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/ciab-micropv.png" @path %}">

  </a>
</figure>

But one by one and from the start...

## Background

The [initial impetus](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/116) dates back to mid 2022 and has been discussed several times in the Sovereign Cloud Stack community. The basic idea is to develop a single-node image of our SCS reference implementation that can easily be installed on a mediocre computer system. This allows us to showcase the SCS reference implementation at conferences on the one hand and to perform hands-on experiments with our technology on the other hand. Basically, it's like a sandbox for nerds that sits in your basement or under your desk. ü§ì

Shortly after [Alexander](https://scs.community/diab) joined our team, he took the lead and organized some test systems for our community. Thanks again for your great effort! üôè

We currently have some of the following configurations distributed within our community which allows us to develop and to test the anticipated *Cloud in a box* image:

* Supermicro Server Mainboard H12SSL-NT with 2x RJ45 @ 10 Gbit/s
* AMD Epyc 7313P, 16 Cores/32 Threads, 3.00 ‚Äì 3.70GHz
* 128GB DDR4 ECC Ram
* 2x 1024GB NVMe storage

The hardware comes in a nice ATX chassis by Fractal Design and therefore has definitely no reason to be shy at events.

## All roads lead to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium

The first time ever we had the chance to put our fingers on this brand new toy was at the [first SCS Community Hackathon]({% post_url blog/2022-11-25-hackathon-wrapup %}) happening November last year in Cologne. Kurt brought along his system and we were able to install a very first MVP initially developed by OSISM some weeks earlier.
