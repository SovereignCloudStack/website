## The SCS Central API is available as a Technical Preview now

Now, this is a *technical preview*, so not all work we want to be included in our first full release is currently done.

However, we think our implementation is far along enough to be handed over to you, to experiment with it and hopefully provide us with some feedback on how we are doing. Check [further down below](#get-involved) to see how to get involved!
