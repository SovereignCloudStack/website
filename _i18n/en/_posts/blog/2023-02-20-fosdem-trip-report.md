Two weeks ago europes largest conference for free and open source took place in Brussels, Belgium. 
[FOSDEM 2023](https://www.fosdem.org) is comprised of many so-called devrooms, each of the rooms dedicated
to a certain topic or community.

Together with [Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/), a collaborative initiative by RedHat, [MOC Alliance](https://massopen.cloud/)
and OpenInfra Labs, we organized the [Sovereign Cloud devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/sovereign_cloud/).
As such most of the saturday was spent in the Sovereign Cloud devroom. Thanks to a lot of awesome presentors
we've had a day full of interesting talks. For FOSDEM the topic was rather niche, yet the room was almost
always filled to at least 80% capacity and the feedback that we received at the end of the day gave us the
impression that it was not only well received but that people did actually take insights and learnings home
with them.

Saturday evening the [OpenInfra foundation](https://openinfra.dev) invited their friends to a meetup. A great way to connect with all
the folks from the OpenInfra community running around in Brussels and at FOSDEM. Among others, I had the chance 
to get to know [Robert Holling](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7028085889545207808/), who will be 
presenting their [Open Campus Infrastructure powered by OpenStack](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7029170851237257216/)
at this years [OpenInfra Summit](https://openinfra.dev/summit/vancouver-2023) in Vancouver.

FOSDEM, which is completly run by volunteers, does have an amazing video team. All of the talks are recorded
as well as live streamed. Because of the recordings there is no reason to have the slightes fear of missing out.
This is yet another reason for me to spend time in the hallway track as well. FOSDEM is one of those conferences
where, if I want to catch a talk at a certain time, I have to start walking there an hour early, since otherwise
all the people I meet on the way will cause me to miss the talk ;)
To be honest, I underestimated how much of the saturday I'd spend in our devroom organizing, so this time
sunday was mostly talking with friends time.
Not only was it a weekend I spend reconnecting with lot's of friends - I had the chance to spend time with
my colleagues [Kurt](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kurt-garloff_fosdem23-sovereigncloud-openinfrastructure-activity-7028038003520368640-_4L1) 
and Max. As much as I love working remote, it is always nice to hang out together in 3D ;)
