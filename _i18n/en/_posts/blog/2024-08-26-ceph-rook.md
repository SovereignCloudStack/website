## Ceph Deployment with Rook

With the [depreceation](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/commit/a9d1ec844d24fcc3ddea7c030eff4cd6c414d23d) of ceph-ansible, SCS now supports Ceph deployment with [Rook](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Getting-Started/intro/), a [graduated-level cloud-native project](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/).

## OSISM Reference Implementation

In OSISM, Rook is can be deployed using the officially recommended [Helm Charts](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Helm-Charts/helm-charts/). Ansible is used to deploy the Helm charts for both the [Rook Operator](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/tree/main/roles/rook_operator) and the [Rook Custom Resoruce Definitions](https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-services/tree/main/roles/rook).

Rook deployment has also been integrated into the [OSISM testbed](https://osism.tech/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed). If you have a running testbed, you can login with `make login` and view the various OSISM commands related to rook by simply typing `osism apply` and grepping for 'rook':

```
dragon@testbed-manager:/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy$ osism apply | grep rook
| rook                                                             | rook           |
| rook-cleanup                                                     | rook           |
| rook-crd                                                         | rook           |
| rook-fetch-keys                                                  | rook           |
| rook-helm                                                        | rook           |
| rook-operator                                                    | rook           |
```

To install a minimal working rook you can use the helper script located in `/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-rook-services.sh`, which automates the installation of [k3s](https://docs.scs.community/docs/operating-scs/components/monitoring/docs/k3s/) and then runs the following commands:

```
osism apply rook-operator
osism apply rook
osism apply rook-fetch-keys

# the role for the cephclient is informed which type of client should be installed. 
echo "cephclient_install_type: rook" >> /opt/configuration/environments/infrastructure/configuration.yml
osism apply cephclient
```

Note: the cephclient for OSISM is configured specifically for rook. It is a small role that ensures only the Rook client is setup.

## Configuration

Rook can be configured by editing the variables for the Helm chart in the file `environments/rook/configuration.yml`. For more information on the various configuration options, see the [SCS configration guide](https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/guides/configuration-guide/rook).

The OSISM testbed provides the following default configuration at `/opt/configuration/environments/rook/config.yml` on the manager node:
