Community,

with only one week left until we finally meet in Cologne for our first SCS Community Hackathon, I want to highlight some of the organizational details for this event.

## Date/Time

The Community Hackathon will take place on Tuesday, 2022-11-22 from 13:00 CET until 21:00 CET.

## Venue

The location is kindly provided by [plusserver](https://www.plusserver.com/). We'll meet at Welserstra√üe 14, 51149 K√∂ln (https://what3words.com/nearing.after.topic). The venue will be accessible from 09:00 CET. We have no hard limit for the end of the Hackathon, but we'd like to spent an unofficial evening with you downtown and end the day together in a bar.

## Agenda

> Every contribution is welcome and worth bringing in. Just like a puzzle - all the little pieces make up a great picture.

The Community Hackathon is what you make it. Please contribute to our open agenda and invite your friends to tackle a specific topic. Don't hesitate to propose a working stream and raise your voice for the domain that matters to you. You want to gather for fostering our knowledge base and peer-think about how to maintain a good documentation? Propose it for our agenda! You're interested in creating a strong ecosystem around SCS? Draft a working session and get us around the table!

Feel free to add your proposal to [this pad](https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2022-11-scs-hackathon-ccaa) and don't hesitate to reach out [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-hackathons:matrix.org) or via this mailing list in order to find fellows.

Don't worry. You don't have to ultimately commit to one working session. We will follow the Law of Two Feet that states:

> If, during the course of the gathering, any person finds themselves in a situation where they are neither learning nor contributing, they can go to some more productive place.

The basic time frame of the day will be as follows:

* **13:15 CET**: Opening by Stephan and Eduard
* **15:00 CET**: Guided data center tour group 1
* **16:00 CET**: Guided data center tour group 2
* **17:00 CET**: Pizza Break üçï
* **21:00 CET**: Closing and moving downtown together

## Health and safety

Please test yourself before you join us during the Hackathon. We will not control the test results, but trust in your awareness to create a safe event for our community. Wearing masks during the event is optional. **However, during the guided data center tour wearing a FFP2 mask is mandatory.** We will provide test kits and FFP2 masks at the venue in case you forgot something to bring along.

## Virtual attendance

We are aware that not everyone is able or wants to attend this physical meetup. If you still want to participate in the Community Hackathon, you are welcome to join our channel [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-hackathons:matrix.org). Please contact the working stream organizers directly if you want to participate in one of the proposed sessions. We will surely find a way to onboard you to the hack'n'fun.

## Food and beverages

We thank [plusserver](https://www.plusserver.com/), who will provide us with enough food and drinks on this day. We'll definitely make sure that no one must leave hungry. üòâ

## Social Media

Please help us to spread the word about this great event and make the public aware of the awesome momentum within our community. You can use the above banner for your social media accounts or posts to raise awareness about  your participation among your audience. Don't forget to tag your posts with #SCSCH2022 and leave a mention for [@Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/sovereigncloudstack), [@sovereigncloudstack@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@sovereigncloudstack), and/or [@scs_osballiance](https://twitter.com/scs_osballiance).
