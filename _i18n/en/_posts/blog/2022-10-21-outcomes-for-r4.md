## Looking towards Release 4

We've just [released the Release 3](https://scs.community/release/2022/09/21/release3/) and with that we immediatly started our R4 cycle.
Of course there are certain topics that we carry over from R3, especially since we work in a very iterative way, these turnovers mark a good spot to actually look at what we want to achieve with the next release cycle. While the majority of planning is done in our team meetings, Kurt, Christian and Felix prepared some initial work.
For that we looked at the funding proposal, which is document that is the groundwork for our funding by the BMWK, and matched that with the work we've done so far. Likewise we looked at the currently running tenders as well the ones we're planning to kick off over the period of the next four months, since those tenders will play into the work we can get done for R4.

Features and functions are the heart of development and the level on which we often discuss in the planning sessions. Features as part of user stories come together in epics.
When we look at SCS and the releases, we don't just want to "throw a bunch of features over the fence". We want to enable Operators of cloud computing infrastructure, we want to provide building blocks for digital sovereignty for operators to provide innovative offers to their customers.

### [SCS is federated](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/18)

While there were efforts done during the R2 and R3 cycles to work towards federated environments, as also shown [during the last GAIA-X hackathon](https://scs.community/2022/09/28/gaia-x-hackathon-5/) there will be lot's of activity on federation during the Release 4 cycle. With a [fantastic workshop](https://input.osb-alliance.de/p/2022-10-scs-iam-workshop) with members of The SIG (Special Interest Group) IAM as well as further members of our community we kicked this off in the first week of the R4 cycle.

### [SCS enables Operators with an excellent toolbox](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/20)

SCS is comprised of three pillars: Standards, Reference Implementation and Open Operations. For this to be viable an excellent toolbox is needed. Ranging from the [OpenStack Image Manager](https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager), our effort to [provide a status page application](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/123) to the Health Monitor.
The OpenStack Image Manger is the way to assure that a cloud based on the IaaS reference implementation carries the mandated images. Plans are to move the OpenStack Image Manager to a full-fledged [OpenStack Swiss Army Knife](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/317). 

### [SCS is continously built and tested](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/21)

The R3 cycle has - once again ;) - shown how important a very good continous integration is. With SCS we want to enable operators to keep their environments constantly up to date.
That two of our operators were able to directly upgrade to Release 3 shows that we're on the right track.
