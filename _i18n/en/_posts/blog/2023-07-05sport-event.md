Also this year we want to continue the tradition to scale the run (or walk, or ride, ...). We will have our next sports event.

We compete in teams in the types of sport: running, cycling, hiking, swimming. But the teams will be random teams, so every attendee signs up with the hint in which sport he or she wants to compete, multiple choices are possible, if an attendee is able to compete in more than one type of sport. The SIG Community triggers the teams anonymized, depending on the mentioned sports. All team mates then get a mail to introduce their team and the sport to complete [Sign up here](https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/forms/tBpJLwaArj4eRHpt)

This year not the fastest time counts, this year the most kilometers are crucial. The team with the most kilometers wins. Because this will be a sponsored event (more information below). 

### Rules for the event:
* In week cw 36/37: 9. - 15.09.2023 every attendee completes their sport and tries to run/walk/cycle/swim as long as he/she is able to in one track at one day (at least only one track at one day is measured for the final result, attendees could try on every day to beat their own distance)
* Every attendee report their best result, all results of a team are collected to get the final team result
* The team with the most kilometers wins
* We will find a compensation for cycling in mountains areas (ideas to do so are very welcome!)
* No e-bikes, no virtual cycling/running are allowed

### Every kilometer counts - sponsoring our sport event
The event is a sponsored/donation event. And there are several possibilities to sponsor:
* sponsors pay a little sum for every x, the sponsor decides how much they will offer
    * x =
    * 5 km running
    * 20 km walking/hiking
    * 30 km cycling
    * 1 km swimming
    * (these numbers can be collected, so if one attendee runs 4 km, another 11 km, the sum will be 15 = 3x, for example)
* sponsors pay a bigger sum for the kilometers of one team
* sponsors pay a sum for every kilometer of one type of sport
* sponsors pay a fixed sum

All the collected oney will be donated to a social digitization project.
