Community,

remember when we gathered for a [Community Run last year](https://scs.community/2021/09/29/run2021/)?
More than thirty members of our community competed in a 10K race during the autumn's
[Running Days](https://laufcampus-runningdays.com/en/). We have proven that Sovereign Cloud Stack
is running both — on the ground and in the cloud. Thank you for participating in this first
athletic event within our community!

## It's that time again!

Yes, exactly – it's happening again! We kindly invite you to participate in our upcoming
**Community Triathlon** this year. Let's prove once again that we not only perform
exceptionally well as technical squads, but also as sports teams.

### The triathlon

Our triathlon will take place from **October 1 to October 10**. During this time, the
competing teams engage in the disciplines of running, swimming and cycling.
Each team must consist of at least three people. The best time in each discipline
will be counted towards the team's overall time.

{% include triathlon2022/disciplines.html %}

You can choose which of the disciplines you like most and how you want to distribute
them among your team. However, each person may only check in one result for your team's
overall score.

Our event is a distributed event. Thus, you can run, swim or cycle wherever you
prefer, or – if you're up to – your team can compete together in the various disciplines.

### Individual rankings and other disciplines

As we did last year, we will again honor your individual performance in
the disciplines of running, swimming and/or cycling. In addition, there will be a special
classification in the discipline of walking.
