Two weeks after this year's [OpenInfra Summit in Berlin]({% post_url 2022-06-02-scs-at-oifsummit2022 %})
we are still overwhelmed by the impressions of this for us very important conference.
A multitude of great speakers and the overall welcoming and motivating atmosphere made this event unique.
Many thanks to the whole [OpenInfra Foundation team](https://openinfra.dev/about/staff/) who made
this summit possible and to [FNTECH](https://www.fntech.com/) for the successful organization of
the event. You rock! ðŸ¤˜

With this blogpost we would like to provide you with the slides of our various presentations,
point out some recordings worth seeing and give you a preview of the next milestones in our project.
