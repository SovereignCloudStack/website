Two weeks after this year's [OpenInfra Summit in Berlin]({% post_url 2022-06-02-scs-at-oifsummit2022 %})
we are still overwhelmed by the impressions of those three days at the Berlin Conference Center (bcc).
With our reference implementation being built upon OpenStack the OpenInfra Summit is the major conference
for us - obviously we brought our share of talks and contributions to the table as well.

A multitude of great speakers and the overall welcoming and motivating atmosphere made this event unique.
Many thanks to the whole [OpenInfra Foundation team](https://openinfra.dev/about/staff/) who made
this summit possible and to [FNTECH](https://www.fntech.com/) for the successful organization of
the event. You rock! ðŸ¤˜

All of the talks at the Summit were recorded and are published. Within the SCS community we assembled a list of
talks that we thought were really great.

## Sessions and recordings worth seeing


## Contributions and talk from the SCS communtiy

The first day started with keynotes and we were thrilled that PStS Dr. Brantner from the Federal Ministry of economic affairs and climate
action [shared her thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlPLGmBfaVc&t=4420s).
Eduard had the chance to present our views on [Digital sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2hQQFJi3Yo) and why open infrastructure
matters. The subject of digital sovereignty is important - as such Eduard was assigned [another slot on day two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvz2PcHq0yY).

Kurt and Felix presented the [Open Operations concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGuUty7ufN8) - maybe this will become the fifth _open paradigm_?
The talk was well received and sparked discussions around the hallway track. There was a forum session on Day three together with the folks from
[Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) on _Open Operations_ which featured a packed room. We will move this subject further and spark
more discussions and actions within our community.

The learnings and building blocks from our Special Interest Group Monitoring were presented by Felix and Mathias in their
talk on [Observability in OpenStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9lk3Jk15Wc).
