We're excited to announce that our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for extending the monitoring from the IaaS layer to a solution that covers observability and monitoring full-stack has achieved a presentable and viable state. MVP aims to provide a global
monitoring view of various SCS layers and components, including KaaS, IaaS, and actively
used services within the SCS community such as Jitsi, HedgeDoc, Nextcloud, Harbor container
registry, and more. The global view is made possible by the Observer monitoring solution
we've designed. The Observer enables the collection, storage, and visualization of metrics
from the SCS infrastructure.

While the Observer monitoring solution is currently part of the MVP, our vision is to evolve
it into an SCS product in future versions, once it reaches the required stability. Monitoring
of the KaaS layer, monitoring of the IaaS layer, and monitoring of infrastructure services
are illustrative examples of how this Observer monitoring solution can be utilized. Furthermore,
the stack employed for observing the KaaS layer and infrastructure services is also designed to
evolve into an SCS product in future stable versions.

## The architecture

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture implemented in our MVP.
To explore the code and detailed documentation, head over to the [k8s-observability](https://github.com/sovereignCloudStack/k8s-observability) repository.
If you're keen on delving deeper, check out the repository's README and try setting up your
own MVP deployment locally using KinD.

Furthermore, we've deployed the MVP publicly, offering handy and well-organized dashboards
that showcase metrics gathered from the SCS infrastructure. Be sure to check out the upcoming
blog section for the Observer (Grafana UI) links. It's a must-see!

To enhance your experience, we've made the monitoring of the KaaS layer more interactive.
You can create your own Kubernetes cluster and observe how it gets registered and
visualized in the Observer. [It's worth giving it a try!](#monitoring-of-the-kaas-layer)

The SCS Monitoring MVP is developed on the foundation of the [dNation monitoring solution](https://github.com/dNationCloud/kubernetes-monitoring).

## Monitoring of the KaaS Layer

As mentioned earlier, we aim to showcase how the Observer monitors the CSP KaaS offering.
To make this demonstration interactive, we've developed a KaaS mock service, allowing
you to easily create a Kubernetes cluster.

The KaaS mock service is accessible through [Swagger UI](http://213.131.230.7:8080/kaas).

Don't hesitate to [create](http://213.131.230.7:8080/kaas#/Clusters/create_cluster_api_clusters__post) your own Kubernetes cluster
within approximately three minutes. You'll find it displayed on the dedicated [Observer high-level dashboard](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/kaas-monitoring/kaas-monitoring).
For a deeper exploration of metrics, simply drill down and click on the cluster you created.
Feel free to experiment, such as triggering monitoring [alerts](http://213.131.230.73:30001/#/alerts) by initiating actions like destroying specific components üòé.

Please note that there is a restriction of a maximum of 10 clusters, as the KaaS mock
service operates on a single VM. Additionally, it's important to keep in mind that this
monitoring solution isn't real-time, meaning it doesn't react immediately to your actions.
However, you can typically expect a response within a few minutes.

## Monitoring of the IaaS Layer

To highlight the Observer's capability in monitoring the IaaS layer, we utilized the [OSISM testbed](https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/guides/deploy-guide/examples/testbed)
deployment as a demonstration within this MVP. The OSISM testbed has been patched,
enabling the Observer to scrape metrics via the Thanos sidecar.
Explore the dedicated [Observer high-level dashboard](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/testbed/iaas-monitoring) for a list of alerts
present in our OSISM testbed and access links to dashboards we copied (and made functional) from the testbed Grafana.

## Monitoring of Infrastructure Services

To demonstrate the Observer's capability in monitoring CSP infrastructure services deployed
on top of the IaaS layer, we chose to monitor key SCS infrastructure elements such as the
SCS Observer cluster itself, the SCS Harbor Kubernetes cluster, and various endpoints
of SCS services regularly used by the SCS community, including the SCS webpage, SCS docs page, SCS Jitsi instance,
SCS HedgeDoc, and more.
Explore the [high-level infrastructure dashboard](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/monitoring/infrastructure-services-monitoring), drill down,
and click on the service you want to investigate deeper.

For example, dive into detailed Harbor metrics by following this path: [infrastructure dashboard](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/monitoring/infrastructure-services-monitoring) -> [harbor cluster](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/e1b111ecbb5185e637d5a7eef26e850f/kubernetes-monitoring-harbor?refresh=10s&var-datasource=PC96415006F908B67&var-cluster=harbor-cluster) -> scroll to the bottom and click on the [harbor app dashboard](http://213.131.230.73:30000/d/harbor/harbor?var-job=harbor&refresh=10s&var-datasource=PC96415006F908B67&var-cluster=harbor-cluster).

üîç Happy monitoring!
