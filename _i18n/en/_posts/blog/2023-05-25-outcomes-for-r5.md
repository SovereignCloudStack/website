## Pedaling towards Release 5 - an overview of our outcomes

To align the development efforts of our community we started thinking in *Outcomes* when looking at the development cycle - much rather than simply talking about the next features that are planned and worked on.
With SCS we deliver not just building blocks for digital sovereign cloud infrastructure - we change the way such infrastructure is operated and viewed.
The outcomes allow us to look through various angles on our development efforts. Each outcomes is reflected through a label within our github repositories, so that Issues and Pull Requests can be labeled accordingly. Furthermore in the projects view we've added various filtered views to be able to quickly see which issues and working items play into which outcomes.

An [overall board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/28) summarizes all of them.


## [SCS is standardized](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/23)

While the S in SCS (at least the first ;) stands for *Sovereign* it could also stand for *Standardized*.
SCS standardizes. Creating Standards within the community, reaching out to surrounding communities, working with upstream as well as other players in our ecosystem to make sure we don’t “just reinvent the wheel” or stew in their own juice is a fair share of our work within the project.

Alongside the standardization work that has happened in the container and IaaS teams with [tender 10](https://scs.community/tenders/lot10) an importan tender package just kicked off and the work of this tender will play a significant role throughout the Release 5 cycle.

## [SCS is understandable](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/22)

In the last half year the [documentation page](https://docs.scs.community) already came to life and with the efforts of the SIG Documentation it is not just a pile of documents but has a concept to it. However in order for SCS to be understandable more than just awesome docs are needed. Collecting feedback from SCS integrators just as much as people and organizations that have their first touchpoint with SCS plays an important role to assure SCS is continously becoming more understandable. 


## [SCS enables](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/20)

For the R4 development cycle one of the outcomes we proclaimed was *SCS enables Operators with an excellent toolbox*. An excellent toolbox is part of what is needed for operating cloud infrastructure as a commodity. Looking at what we’ve done in the past eight months this outcome however is much too narrow. 
*SCS enables* - on a variety of levels and not just operators, but also integrators, developers and most important consumers of infrastructure built upon SCS who want to run on top of fully digital sovereign infrastructure.

## [SCS is transparent](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/30)

Transparency is one of the core values embedded in our project - yet we want to make sure our development efforts throughout the R5 cycles are actively working towards being transparent. This ranges from our development culture (which needs to be transparent not only to be trustworthy but also to lower the barrier to join the community), to the open operations movement and all the way to technical items such as [SBOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain) for our complete stack.
Transparent projects can be audited easily and trust can be built up more easily.


## [SCS is continuously built and tested](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/21)

Throughout the R4 cycle the work on our own [zuul](https://zuul-ci.org) have begun. During the R4 retro the topic came up in va

The R3 cycle has - once again ;) - shown how important a very good continuous integration is. With SCS we want to enable operators to keep their environments constantly up to date with confidence. The fact that two of our operators were able to directly upgrade to Release 3 shows that we’re on the right track.

## [SCS is opinionated](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/29)

While the SCS projects provides a modular stack and stronlgy works towards interoperability, we want to be opinionated in our reference implementation. Being opinionated on that level leads to focus and avoids having to many loose ends. 
A very good example for this is how we addressed the need to monitoring
