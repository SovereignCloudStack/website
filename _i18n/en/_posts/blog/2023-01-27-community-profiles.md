Community,

With huge excitement I would like to announce a new feature on our website that allows you to proudly show off all of your precious contributions to SCS. Your commitment is the foundation of our project's success and we definitely want to honor this!

## Introducing Community Member Profiles

Contributing to an Open Source project such as Sovereign Cloud Stack is not only essential for the project itself, but also a great way to publicly demonstrate your experience and knowledge. Be not humble and share with the rest of the world what you've learned, accomplished or contributed.

For instance, [Arvid](https://scs.community/members/arequate) from [Univention](https://univention.com) published an excellent article on [OpenStack API access with federation to external customer Identity Providers in Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/2023/01/05/sig-iam-openstack-cli-with-federation/), which has been featured on all social media channels by [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/). Isn't it fantastic if this valuable work also creates visibility for the contributor as well as the company?

Creating your individual profile is easy and straightforward. All you have to do is to open a pull request in our [website repository](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/website).
