## Our R6 outcomes 

To align the development efforts of our community we started talking about *Outcomes* when looking at the development cycle.

We've started with this in the R4 cycle and even though we never published them for R5 - we did have them for R5 as well ;)
The idea of these outcomes is to outline what our (development) work does that enables our users (Operators, Integrators and End-Users)
in the end to gain more value from SCS. This outlines our direction much better than talking about the next features that are planned
and worked on. Furthermore the outcomes assist us in our development work to assure that each single epic and story we work on
actually pays into the greater idea.

SCS delivers building blocks for digital sovereign cloud infrastructure.  We change the way infrastructure is operated and by doing
this we want to enable operators to become more efficient and be able to scale better.

#### Working with outcomes on github

The outcomes allow us to look through various angles on our development efforts. Each outcomes is reflected through a label within our github repositories, so that issues and pull requests can be labeled accordingly. Furthermore in the projects view we've added various filtered views to be able to quickly see which issues and working items play into which outcomes.

An [overall board](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/28) summarizes all of them.


### [SCS is standardized](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/23)

While the S in SCS (at least the first ;) stands for *Sovereign* it could also stand for *Standardized*.
SCS standardizes. Creating Standards within the community, reaching out to surrounding communities, working with upstream as well as other players in our ecosystem to make sure we don’t “just reinvent the wheel” or stew in their own juice is a fair share of our work within the project.

Alongside the standardization work that has happened in the container and IaaS teams with [tender 10](https://scs.community/tenders/lot10) an important tender package was kicked off in the beginning of the R5 cycle. Through the work in the SIG Standardization a lot of the topics have gained paced in the last months, yet this is one of the major topics for the R6 cycle.
The [joint-efforts](https://scs.community/2023/11/27/joint-standardization/) with [ALASCA](https://alasca.cloud) emphasises this even more.

### [SCS is fullstack]( )

### [SCS is understandable](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/22)

In the last half year the [documentation page](https://docs.scs.community) already came to life and with the efforts of the SIG Documentation it is not just a pile of documents but has a concept to it. However in order for SCS to be understandable more than just awesome docs are needed. Collecting feedback from SCS integrators just as much as people and organizations that have their first touchpoint with SCS plays an important role to assure SCS is continously becoming more understandable. 


### [SCS enables](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/20)

For the R4 development cycle one of the outcomes we proclaimed was *SCS enables Operators with an excellent toolbox*. An excellent toolbox is part of what is needed for operating cloud infrastructure as a commodity. Looking at what we’ve done in the past eight months this outcome however is much too narrow. 
*SCS enables* - on a variety of levels and not just operators, but also integrators, developers and most important consumers of infrastructure built upon SCS who want to run on top of fully digital sovereign infrastructure.


### [SCS is transparent](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/30)

Transparency is one of the core values embedded in our project - yet we want to make sure our development efforts throughout the R6 cycle are actively working towards being transparent. This ranges from our development culture (which needs to be transparent not only to be trustworthy but also to lower the barrier to join the community), to the open operations movement, the future of the SCS project and all the way to technical items such as [SBOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain) for our complete stack.
Transparent projects can be audited easily and trust can be built up more easily.

### [SCS is continuously built and tested](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/21)


### [SCS is opinionated](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6/views/29)

While the SCS projects provides a modular stack and stronlgy works towards interoperability, we want to be opinionated in our reference implementation. Being opinionated on that level leads to focus and avoids having to many loose ends. 
A very good example for this is how we addressed the need to monitoring
