This upcoming weekend, February 4th and 5th, the 2023 edition of [FOSDEM](https://www.fosdem.org) is happening in Brussels, Belgium.
FOSDEM is the largest gathering of open source developers and is free to attend. Aside from the main conference
tracks the conference has a lot of [devrooms](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/tracks/) dedicated to individual
subjects.

Together with the fine colleagues from [Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) we organize
the [Sovereign Cloud devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/sovereign_cloud/). The Sovereign Cloud devroom
will happen on Saturday in [Room Cornil](https://nav.fosdem.org/l/h1301_cornil/) - Building H, Room 1301.
Thanks to many good submissions there is a nice schedule. From the SCS project there are two talks:

After a welcome by Thorsten from Operate First and me, our colleague Max will talk about [how we created a Documentation Framework that works across a group of vendors in the sovereign cloud stack community](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_how_we_created_a_documentation_framework_that_works_across_a_group_of_vendors/).
In the afternoon Kurt will elaborate on [digital sovereignty and how Open Source Software helps to achieve it](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_what_is_digital_sovereignty_and_how_can_oss_help_to_achieve_it/). I'm actually very happy that among the submissions there were quite a few from friends around us, such
has Thierry Carrez talk on the [role of Open Infrastructure in digital sovereignty](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_the_role_of_open_infrastructure_in_digital_sovereignty/), Marcel 

There are numerous other devrooms that touch topics that are relevant to the SCS community - to be honest, basically all of them do, so this is just an excerpt. ;)

* [Containers](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/containers/)
* [Virtualization and IaaS](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/virtualization_and_iaas/)
* [Software Defined Storage](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/software_defined_storage/)
* [CI/CD](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/)
* [Software Bill of Materials](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/software_bill_of_materials/)

If you now have the urge to develope [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), no worries: All the talks are recorded and available for later consumption!

If you come to FOSDEM and want to meet for coffee, beer or food: be sure to reach out!
