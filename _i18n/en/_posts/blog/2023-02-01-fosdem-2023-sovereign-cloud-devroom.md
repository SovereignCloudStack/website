[FOSDEM 2023](https://www.fosdem.org) is only a few nights away! This upcoming weekend, February 4th and 5th,
the 2023 edition of FOSDEM is happening in Brussels, Belgium. FOSDEM is the largest gathering of open source
developers and is free to attend. Aside from the main conference tracks the conference is mainly about all the
[devrooms](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/tracks/) dedicated to individual subjects and/or communities.

Together with the fine colleagues from [Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) we organize
the [Sovereign Cloud devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/sovereign_cloud/). The Sovereign Cloud devroom
will happen on Saturday in [Room Cornil](https://nav.fosdem.org/l/h1301_cornil/) - Building H, Room 1301.
Thanks to many good submissions there is a nice schedule. From the SCS project there are two talks:

After a welcome by Thorsten from Operate First and me, our colleague Max will talk about [how we created a Documentation Framework that works across a group of vendors in the sovereign cloud stack community](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_how_we_created_a_documentation_framework_that_works_across_a_group_of_vendors/).
In the afternoon Kurt will elaborate on [digital sovereignty and how Open Source Software helps to achieve it](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_what_is_digital_sovereignty_and_how_can_oss_help_to_achieve_it/). I'm actually very happy that among the submissions there were quite a few from friends around us, such
as

* Thierry Carrez talk on the [role of Open Infrastructure in digital sovereignty](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_the_role_of_open_infrastructure_in_digital_sovereignty/)
* Marcel Hild who will give an [overview of the Operate First project](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_operate_first_community_cloud/) 

and Peter Zaitsev that will answer the [question wether Open Source is coming to a cloud near you](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/sovcloud_is_open_source_coming_back_to_your_cloud/).

There are numerous other devrooms that touch topics that are relevant to the SCS community - to be honest, basically all of them do, so this is just an excerpt. ;)

* [Containers](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/containers/)
* [Virtualization and IaaS](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/virtualization_and_iaas/)
* [Software Defined Storage](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/software_defined_storage/)
* [CI/CD](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/)
* [Software Bill of Materials](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/software_bill_of_materials/)

If you now have the urge to develop [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), no worries: All the talks will be recorded and available for later consumption!

If you come to FOSDEM and want to meet for coffee, beer or food: be sure to reach out! Some of us will be heading to the 
[OpenInfra Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/brussels-openinfra-meetup-group/events/290894971/) on Saturday evening, so if you don't have the time
during the day, that will be a good place to catch us.
