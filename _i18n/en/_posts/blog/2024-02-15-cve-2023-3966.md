## The vulnerability

Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to crafted Geneve
packets causing invalid memory accesses and potential denial of service.
Triggering the vulnerability requires that Open vSwitch has flow hardware
offload with Linux TC flower enabled (other_config:hw-offload=true).
It is not enabled by default.

The issue is caused by insufficient validation of Geneve metadata
fields in the offload path.  Open vSwitch versions 2.12 and newer are
affected.

The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2023-3966](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3966).

## Impact on the SCS reference implementation

The [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) reference
implementation (by [OSISM](https://osism.tech/)) comes with and utilizes 
Open vSwitch. While hardware offloading is not enabled by default most
environments will have it enabled.

In any case, operators of OpenStack platforms are advised to deploy fixed versions as soon as possible.

## Mitigation and Fixes

For any version of Open vSwitch, disabling flow hardware offload will
prevent the issue (setting other_config:hw-offload=false and reboot
the system).  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability
this way because it may impact the overall system throughput.

By default, flow hardware offload support is not enabled.

Open vSwitch has been updated to [version 3.1.4](https://www.openvswitch.org/releases/NEWS-3.1.4.txt).
Updated images have been built by [OSISM](https://osism.tech/) and are available to be installed.

Set `openvswitch_tag: "2023.1"` in the configuration repository in `environments/kolla/configuration.yml`.
Afterwards run `osism apply -an upgrade openvswitch`.

This will deploy the latest images of the Antelope series. This includes openvswitch 3.1.4.
