## SCS Release 6 countdown begins

The product board meeting has considered and confirmed the release date for the upcoming SCS Release 6.

Mark your calendars because the release date for SCS Release 6 has been set for *March 20th, 2024*.

Stay tuned for additional information as we approach the release day â€“ the countdown is officially underway!

### How to help with making this release even better?

One of the best ways to contribute and help ensure that Release 6 is the best version yet is to assist with testing.
Another great way is to help with items such as the Release Notes. There is a [r6 branch](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/tree/feat/r6) in
the [release-notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes) repository with a [work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/16).
