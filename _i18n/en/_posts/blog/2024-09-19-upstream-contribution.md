## Motivation

When deploying and operating an OpenStack installation, it is quite natural to discover bugs or features that
do not work as one would like them to work. This seems to be a natural entry point to contribute upstream,
either by creating a bug report, submitting a patch or discussing some design decision with the developers.

At least this is how it worked for me, then one thing led to another: Once you submit a patch, you'll see CI
results that are triggered by your patch, likely some of these are not passing on the first attempt, so you
start looking into what these jobs are actually doing, how to find the logs they generate and how to interpret
them.

Contacting the people that operate the CI and discussing possible issues with it happens via IRC. Once you are
connected there, you also see what issues other people are having, try to understand what is happening or help
them if possible.

In the end this leads to a continous interplay of taking and giving, a community working together for a common
goal: Making the OpenStack project a healthy, stable and successful endeavour.

## QA Team - devstack and the gate

> DevStack is a series of extensible scripts used to quickly bring up a complete OpenStack environment based
> on the latest versions of everything from git master. It is used interactively as a development environment
> and as the basis for much of the OpenStack projectâ€™s functional testing.

https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/

One of the first OpenStack projects that I started contributing to was DevStack. Since for almost all
OpenStack repos their functional CI jobs are based on devstack and tempest, this is a crucial piece of code
for the whole project, so contributing to keep things in a healthy state is an important task.

The QA team has grown very small over the last five years or so, currently there are only three core reviewers
remaining that are regularly active. This is despite the team having been listed in the "help most wanted"
list for essentially since it exists
https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/upstream-investment-opportunities/2023/quality-assurance-developers.html.

Typical contributions include:
* Triaging and answering bug reports
* Reviewing change requests
* Debugging CI failures and root-causing them
* Fixing issues that arise
* Ensuring support for new distro versions
* Responding to questions and comments in the IRC channel
* Taking part in the weekly meetings

Without these, OpenStack development would soon grind to a halt, since lacking a working CI, no further
patches could be merged, no releases made and published, no bugs get fixed. So let us take a closer look at
how some of the above items work.

## Launchpad Bug tracking

The [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) site is a complete code hosting and development site, similar to
GitHub. It is being developed and operated by [Canonical Ltd.](https://canonical.com/), the company behind the
Ubuntu Linux distribution. OpenStack only uses the bug tracking part of launchpad, which is available at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/.

There has also been an attempt from the OpenStack community to develop their own bug tracking software named
[Storyboard](https://opendev.org/opendev/storyboard), an instance of this is still running at
https://storyboard.openstack.org/. However this never became feature-complete compared to the Launchpad bug
tracker, so the migration to storyboard was stopped and a lot of project that had already switched to it have
since migrated back to Launchpad.

Users that discover a bug within OpenStack can report it at the URL that can be found in the documentation and
most of the time matches the project name, for example https://bugs.launchpad.net/devstack.

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/launchpad-devstack-index.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/launchpad-devstack-index.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

The landing page shows a list of the open bug reports together with their priority and status, some statistics
on the number of open bugs, and finally a "Report a bug" button.

## Gerrit Code Review

The code review service [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) offers a web interface to allow an
efficient workflow for reviewing changes (the equivalent of what GitHub users know as pull requests). Take a
look at this devstack change for example:

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

On the left of the upper half of the screen you can see all relevant details about the change, like the Owner,
the list of Reviewers and the current status of the review.

The box in the middle shows the commit messsage, which should contain all the information that the author of
the patch deems to be important for the reviewer to know and should also contain enough context so that future
developer can understand the meaning of the change when looking at it in the git history years into the
future.

On the right hand side of the upper half, changes are listed that are somehow related to the current patch.
The "Relation chain" lists other commits that were submitted together in a single branch. In GitHub those
would all be reviewed in one single piece as a pull request, in Gerrit however each commit is individually
tested and reviewed. Gerrit also allows to group reviews together by setting a common topic on them, these
reviews are shown in the "Same topic" list.

Below all this, the list of files that are touched by the change is shown. It includes some helpful hints,
like an indicator whether a file was newly added ("A"), modified ("M") or deleted ("D"), and the amount of
lines changed (or number of bytes for non-text files).

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change2.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change2.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

If we scroll further down, the log of events that affect this change is shown. This includes the initial
upload of the change for review, test results produced by the CI system (Zuul) and comments from reviewer,
including the votes that they left on the change.

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change-file.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change-file.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

By clicking on a file name, one can take a look at what changed in this file, in this particular case for
lines were deleted. Clicking on a line allow to add some comment that will be shown attached to that line and
can thus be used to ask the reviewer for explanation in case something is unclear, suggest changes to the
commit, or possibly just leave comments for other reviewers.

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change-submit.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/gerrit-devstack-change-submit.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

After going through all files, the "Reply" button on the main page will submit the review, adding all the
comments together with possibly a vote (-1 in this case since changes to the review are needed).

Most of this can be done by any interested contributor, the only requirement is to register an account, and
this is indeed a great option to start interacting with the community, seeing which topics are currently being
worked upon, learning about interesting parts of the code and helping to improve the quality of the software
that is being produced.

The only part where actual Core-Reviewer rights are needed is when it comes to actually approving a change to
be merged into the common code tree. This will usually require two different reviewer to leave a "+2" code
review on the patch and then to also submit a "Workflow+1" vote. At this point, the change will still not get
merged immediately, but instead the CI will perform another run of jobs, verifying all tests are still
passing, and only if these tests are successful, Zuul will instruct Gerrit to actually merge the change.

## Zuul - Stop merging broken code

> Keep your builds evergreen by automatically merging changes only if they pass tests

https://zuul-ci.org/

Initially testing the OpenStack project was using existing CI software like Jenkins to run its tests on
proposed changes. However a couple of limitations became apparent that in the end led to the development of a
new software: Zuul (see https://opensource.com/article/20/2/zuul for some overview of the history)

OpenDev's instance of Zuul can be found at https://zuul.opendev.org/, it is not only serving OpenStack as one
of its tenants, but also the Zuul project itself as well as some other projects.

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/zuul-status.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/zuul-status.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

The status page for each tenant shows the current state of the CI: Lists of currently running jobs, grouped by
pipeline, together with an estimation of how long it will take for these jobs to finish, based on historical
data from previous job executions.

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:50%">
  <a href="{% asset "blog/upstream-contribution/zuul-build.png" @path %}">
    {% asset 'blog/upstream-contribution/zuul-build.png' class="figure-img w-100" %}
  </a>
</figure>

Looking at an individual build allows to see its status and to dig deeper into what went wrong in case there
was a failure. One can either follow the sequence of Ansible tasks that were executed in the Console view or
check the Logs that were collected.

## OpenDev - the glue that holds everything together

> OpenDev is an evolution of the OpenStack Infrastructure project. The goal is to make OpenStackâ€™s proven
> software development tools available for projects outside of OpenStack. We believe that Free Software needs
> Free tools and OpenDev provides one such set that has been proven to work at large and small scales of
> development.

https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/system-config/latest/project.html

The OpenDev team is operating all - or most of - the infrastructure that is being used in the development of
OpenStack. This includes:

* The gitea server farm https://opendev.org/
* The gerrit code review server https://review.opendev.org/
* The Zuul CI system https://zuul.opendev.org/

Add to that a lot of additional systems that help with development, monitoring and collaboration. Most of the
setup is being automated through the "Infrastructure as Code" concept, but since some of the tasks still
require administrator or root access to the servers, a good amount of experience with systems administration
is needed, as well as having earned the trust of the existing team through previous interactions.

Typical contributions include:

* Reviewing change requests
* Debugging and fixing infrastructure issues
* Responding to questions and comments in the IRC channel
* Taking part in the weekly meetings

## CirrOS - A minimized cloud image

> The CirrOS project provides linux disk and kernel/initramfs images. The images are well suited for testing
>  as they are small and boot quickly.

https://github.com/cirros-dev/cirros

The CirrOS project was developed by Scott Moser in order to have a small cloud image for testing purposes,
which allows to verify some basic functionality while consuming only a minimal amount of resources. This
makes tests work much faster than they would be when using a standard cloud image as provided by the usual
distros like Debian or Ubuntu. It also allows the CI to run multiple tests in parallel without hitting
resource limits on the testing node.

From time to time updates to the image are necessary, be it either using a newer kernel or an updated
software stack - the collection curated by [the buildroot project](https://buildroot.org/)
is being used here - or adding new features or bugfixes.

## neutron-dynamic-routing - IPv6 connectivity for Neutron

The neutron-dynamic-routing project is a small plugin for Neutron that provides the capability to announce
reachability information from OpenStack's virtual networking to the outside world. One particularly important
application of this is to provide IPv6 connectivity with globally reachable addresses to Neutron tenant
networks. This has been documented in a detailed guide
[here](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron-dynamic-routing/latest/install/usecase-ipv6.html).

Due to lack of contributors the project was close to getting abandoned some years ago. But then two
contributors from operators stepped up to keep the project alive: Tobias Urdin from Binero and myself. In the
last months there has also been some renewed interest from other Neutron contributors and so the project can
be considered to be in a healthy state again for now.

## kolla - Automated OpenStack deployments

> Kollaâ€™s mission is to provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating OpenStack clouds.

https://docs.openstack.org/kolla/latest/

Kolla is the basis of the OpenStack deployments provided by OSISM. The development follows an "upstream first"
policy whereever possible. So every new feature gets implemented in the upstream environment, ensuring
compatibility with the current state and thorough testing in the upstream CI, as well as receiving early
feedback from other Kolla developers.  Larger features usually get discussed with the community even before
work on the implementation starts. A good opportunity for this is at the PTG (Projects Team Gathering), which
is happening at the beginning of each 6 month development cycle for OpenStack, and which allows to discuss
ideas, design choices and possible options in a focused, concentrated enviroment where all interested parties
can participate.

The kolla project is using a large set of CI jobs to ensure that all features are working as expected and
to prevent changes from introducing regressions. These jobs cover a lot of different deployment scenarios,
each of them getting executed for all supported distributions - Debian, Rocky Linux and Ubuntu.

Typical contributions include:

* Reviewing change requests
* Debugging and fixing CI issues
* Responding to questions and comments in the IRC channel
* Taking part in the weekly meetings

## Release Team - Ensuring quality and stability

> OpenStack is developed and released around 6-month cycles. After the initial release, additional stable
> point releases will be released in each release series.

https://releases.openstack.org/

The release team is responsible for overseeing the OpenStack release process. This includes verifying
the correctness of releases that are being made for individual deliverables, keeping the infrastructure
that creates these releases in good shape, and coordinating milestones and deadlines across the wider
OpenStack community.

The team is currently very small, not by design, but due to lack of contributors. So being active here
has an especially large impact on the healthiness of the whole project. There is some documentation
about [joining the release team](https://releases.openstack.org/reference/join_release_team.html), which
describes how interested contributors might start helping out by reviewing release patches.

Reviewing release patches is also the major recurring contribution, particular care is needed in
checking that the data are correct and that the reports generated by the CI do not show any possible
issues. From time to time, mostly around the major milestones and the final release, the team also
generates release patches themselves in order to help the other teams by making their part of the
job easier, as they'll just have to verify that the generated patches are correct.

## Technical Committee - Leadership and firefighting

> The OpenStack Technical Committee is the governing body of the OpenStack open source project. It is an
> elected group that represents the contributors to the project, and has oversight on all technical matters.
> This includes developers, operators and end users of the software.

https://governance.openstack.org/tc/

The Technical Committee is the central technical governance body overseeing the while OpenStack project.
It is responsible for deciding upon the guidelines and policies that ensure that all services can work
together in a stable and verified manner. Most actions are getting discussed in the weekly meetings,
with longer term strategic planning also happening at the
[Project Team Gatherings (PTG)] (https://openinfra.dev/ptg/).
