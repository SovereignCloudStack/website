Community,

we're still overwhelmed by the impressions of our first Community Hackathon.
Thank you so much for spending an amazing day with us in Cologne and making a
significant contribution to the success of this event.

First of all, we would like to thank PlusServer for making this day possible.
Shout out to Saskia, Lidia, Stephan and all involved teams. You did a great job
and we're more than happy to have you in our community!

## Results

For the first Community Hackathon, we decided to adopt an open space approach.
You all contributed excellent proposals â€“ both for engineers as well as non-engineers.

In changing groups, the following topics have been adressed:

- Cloud-in-a-box
- Documentation
- Sustainability of the SCS project
- IAM and Federation
- Cloudmon
- ... and many other highly interesting side discussions

We will persist all results of the different working streams within our [public
`minutes` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/minutes/tree/main/hackathons/2022-11-22-scs-hackathon-cologne).

## Summary

After so many months of virtual collaboration, it was amazingly rewarding to be able to discuss, to work with you,
and to push many important topics. We all agreed that we definitely have to organize this format more frequently, and we will!

## Outlook

As you all know: After the Hackathon is before the next Hackathon!
We are looking forward to welcoming you next year in Nuremberg to our second Community Hackathon,
which will be hosted by [OSISM](https://osism.tech), [noris network](https://www.noris.de/) and [Wavecon](https://www.wavecon.de/).

We will soon reveal more details are looking forward to the next great Hack'n'fun!
