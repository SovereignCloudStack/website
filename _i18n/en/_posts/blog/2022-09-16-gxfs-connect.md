As the new ecosystem manager in the SCS team I take the chance to talk here a little about the [GX FS Connect](https://www.gxfs.eu/de/gxfs-connect-2022/) event. The [GAIA-X Federation Services (GX FS)](https://www.gxfs.eu/) under the leadership of [eco, the Association of the Internet Industry](https://www.eco.de/), are – if you like – SCS’ “sister” project. They are the first two subsidized project by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action embedded in the European GAIA-X initiative.

At Station Berlin participants discussed, presented and demonstrated for one and a half days around the topics of Federations and GAIA-X. Eduard and Manuela from our SCS Team presented the Sovereign Cloud Stack in the form of a pitch.

On various occasions the close relationship between SCS and the GAIA-X Federation Services and their importance as foundation technologies for actual and future digital Federations in Europe was emphasized – for example the fact, that the current GX-FS demo-instance is hosted on a SCS-Containerlayer at [pluscloud open](https://www.plusserver.com/produkte/pluscloud-open).
