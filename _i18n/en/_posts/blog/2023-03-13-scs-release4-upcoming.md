## SCS Release 4 on the horizon

For the more active members of our community it has been known for a few weeks, since it was covered in the
Product Board as well as our Community Call. Further hints, such as the [upgrade note](https://scs.community/2023/03/09/gx-scs-r4-upgrade/) for the gx-scs
environment are clear signs, Release 4 is on the horizon ;)

The date for Release 4 has been set to *March 22nd 2023*. 

### How to help with making this release even better?

Right now one of the best ways to chime in and assure that Release 4 will be the best release so far is to help test it.
Another great way is to help with items such as the Release Notes. There is a [branch](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/tree/feat/r4) in
the [release-notes repository](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes) with a [work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/5).
