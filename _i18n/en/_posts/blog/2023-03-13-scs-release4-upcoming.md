## SCS Release 4 on the horizon

For our more active community members, SCS Release 4 has been on the radar for a few weeks now,
as it was covered in both the Product Board and our Community Call. Further hints, such as the
[upgrade note](https://scs.community/2023/03/09/gx-scs-r4-upgrade/) for the gx-scs environment
are clear signs, SCS Release 4 is on the horizon ;)

The release date for SCS Release 4 has been set for *March 22nd, 2023*.

### How to help with making this release even better?

One of the best ways to contribute and help ensure that Release 4 is the best version yet is to assist with testing.
Another great way is to help with items such as the Release Notes. There is a [r4 branch](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/tree/feat/r4) in
the [release-notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes) repository with a [work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/5).
