Dear Community,

we invite you to our third big Community Hackathon in Dresden. With great support from [CLOUD&HEAT](https://www.cloudandheat.com/) and the [ALASCA - Association for Operational Open Cloud Infrastructures e.V.](https://alasca.cloud/en/) this will be again a huge blast!

## Date and time
The third Community Hackathon will take place on **Wednesday, 2023-11-08 from 10:00 to 19:00 CET**. 

On **Tuesday, 2023-11-07 from 16:00/18:00 to 22:00 CET** we will have an open community meeting with a little walk trough Dresden and a get together at 18:00 CET  [Watzke am Goldenen Reiter](https://watzke.de/watzke-am-goldenen-reiter/). Meeting point for the walk will be added soon!

## Arrival at the 8th of November

We will meet at [CLOUD&HEAT](https://www.cloudandheat.com/): **Königsbrücker Straße 96, Halle 15, 01099 Dresden**.

**As access to the building is only possible after prior check-in, we recommend to be on site at 9:30 at the latest. Please bring along a valid ID or passport!** To speed up on-site registration, we will prepare the necessary paperwork for you. 

We will start the hackathon with a welcome session - if you want to be present for that, please arrive by 09:30.

## Overnight stay
If you want to have some time with us after the Hackathon or want to join us for a drink, we recommend the [Motel One Dresden-Palaisplatz](https://www.motel-one.com/de/hotels/dresden/hotel-dresden-palaisplatz/).

## Programm
The day will start with a short introduction of our hosts Cloud&Heat and their energy concept. After that, we will dive into the work phase. As a short break during the day we are invited to an introduction of Yaook and ALASCA with a little snack. After that we go back to our topics and work on. Before dinner we will present all outcomes of the day. As last year, we will follow the [open space approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) and embrace the Law of Two Feet:

> If, during the course of the gathering, any person finds themselves in a situation where they are neither learning nor contributing, they can go to some more productive place. This is not only an accepted, but a desired behavior.

**The Community Hackathon is what you make it!**

### Food and beverage

Between 17:00 and 18:00 we will have an extended break for dinner. We will ensure that vegan and vegetarian options are available. Should you have an allergy, please let us know in advance! 

### Data protection and notices
The security requirements of the location demand personal registration. 

Please note that we will take photos and videos during the course of the event. If you do not agree to this, please inform us during your check-in. In this case you will receive a "No camera" sticker from us, which you please attach visibly to your visitor badge. All photos will be made available in a protected area before publication, so that you can give your veto in any case.

### Contact us
