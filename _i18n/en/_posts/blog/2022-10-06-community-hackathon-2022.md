Community,

after all these months of attending virtual meetings, it's about time for a physical get-together! Let's meet for a memorable day in Cologne and work together on our joint mission: defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform.

**With great support from plusserver, we would like to invite you to our first official community Hackathon on 2022-11-22 from 13:00 to 21:00 CEST in Cologne.**

Don't miss this opportunity to meet all the familiar faces from the many video tiles, to contribute to Sovereign Cloud Stack and to spend a great evening together. Our host, plusserver, is happy to provide us with beverages and food during the day.

Would you like to see the inside of a data center? The plusserver team invites us to a guided tour of the data center located directly under the venue. Please indicate on the registration form that you are interested in this tour.
