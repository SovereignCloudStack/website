Also this year we want to continue the tradition to scale the run (or walk, or ride, ...). We will have our next sports event.

We compete in teams of 3-4 attendees in the types of sport: running, cycling, hiking, swimming. The teams will be randomly composed. Every attendee signs up with the hint in which sport he or she wants to compete. Multiple choices are possible, if an attendee is able to compete in more than one type of sport. The SIG Community draws the teams anonymized, depending on the mentioned sports. All team mates will receive an email to introduce themselves to their respective teams and add their results [Sign up here](https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/apps/forms/tBpJLwaArj4eRHpt)

This year not the fastest time counts, this year the most kilometers are crucial. The team with the most kilometers wins. Because this will be a sponsored event (more information below). 

### Rules for the event:
* In week cw 36/37: 9. - 15.09.2023 every attendee completes their sport and tries to run/walk/cycle/swim as long as he/she is able to in one track at one day (at least only one track at one day is measured for the final result, attendees could try on every day to beat their own distance)
* Every attendee report their best result, all results of a team are collected to get the final team result
* The team with the most kilometers wins
* We will find a compensation for cycling in mountains areas (ideas to do so are very welcome!)
* No e-bikes, no virtual cycling/running are allowed

### Every kilometer counts - sponsoring our sport event
The event is a sponsored/donation event. There are several possibilities to sponsor:
* Sponsors pay an amount, which they determines, for all sports and participants for each (x):
    * x =
    * 1 km running
    * 10 km walking
    * 15 km cycling
    * 0,5 km swimming
    * (these numbers are collected over all teams, so if one participant walks e.g. 12 km and another 18 km, the sum is 30 = 3x10 km walking = 3x amount)
* Sponsors pay a larger amount, which can also be determined by themselves, for the kilometers of a team, which the sponsor chooses in advance
* sponsors pay a self-selected amount for each kilometer of a sport

All the collected oney will be donated to a social digitization project.
