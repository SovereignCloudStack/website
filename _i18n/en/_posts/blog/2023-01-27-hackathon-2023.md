**As access to the building is only possible after prior check-in, we recommend to be on site at 9:30 at the latest. Please bring along a valid ID or passport!** To speed up on-site registration, we will prepare the necessary paperwork for you. 

## Overnight stay

If you want to have breakfast with us before or after the Hackathon or want to join us for a drink, we recommend the [Motel One am Hauptbahnhof](https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/nuremberg/hotel-nuremberg-hauptbahnhof/).

## Programm und Call for Sessions

The day will start with a short tour through the [Data Center Nuremberg South](https://www.noris.de/en/data-centers/dc-nuremberg-south/), to which [noris network AG](https://www.noris.de/) invites us. Afterwards we will move dive into working phase. As last year, we will follow the [open space approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) and embrace the Law of Two Feet:

> If, during the course of the gathering, any person finds themselves in a situation where they are neither learning nor contributing, they can go to some more productive place. This is not only an accepted, but a desired behavior.

**The Community Hackathon is what you make it!** What topics or challenges would you like to work on with other attendees? Let us know so we can announce your proposal on **Thursday, 2023-02-16**.

Between 17:00 and 18:00 we will have an extended break, which will include pizza. We will ensure that vegan and vegetarian options are available. Should you have an allergy, please let us know in advance!

## Data protection and notices

The security requirements of the location demand personal registration. noris Network AG will need to store this for the duration of the retention period and process it in the event of an audit.

Please note that we will take photos and videos during the course of the event. If you do not agree to this, please inform us during your check-in. In this case you will receive a "No camera" sticker from us, which you please attach visibly to your visitor badge. All photos will be made available in a protected area before publication, so that you can give your veto in any case.
