## SCS Release 5 around the corner

The active and involved members of our community are very much aware of it - however I was reminded
today that we should make sure to push this news to be visible to everyone else :)

A lot of the preparations - aside from the work on the various projects themselves - are currently
happening in the various HedgeDoc pads and are in the process of being transferred to the various
release related documents.

The release date for SCS Release 5 has been set for *September 20th, 2023*. This is next week!

### How to help with making this release even better?

One of the best ways to contribute and help ensure that Release 5 is the best version yet is to assist with testing.
Another great way is to help with items such as the Release Notes. There is a [r5 branch](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/tree/feat/r5) in
the [release-notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes) repository with a [work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes/pull/9).
