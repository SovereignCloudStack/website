People with groundbreaking ideas, proven expertise and passion are gathered at SPRIND.

One of the first projects supported by SPRIND is the "Sovereign Cloud Stack" project. It had a feasibility study performed in 2020 on the viability and chances of success for Sovereign Cloud Stack. With a successful result!
