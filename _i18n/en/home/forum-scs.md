## Continuation of SCS after the project completion
{: .mb-3 }

The work of SCS continues after the successful completion of the funded SCS
project on 2024-12-31:

1. [Numerous companies](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org/network/)
   have joined forced to found the [Forum SCS-Standards gegr√ºndet](https://scs.community/2024/10/23/osba-forum-scs-standards/)
   inside the OSBA. The forum aims to continue the work on standardization
   and certifications for the levels *SCS-compatible*, *SCS-open*, and *SCS-sovereign*.
   The trademarks for SCS, Sovereign Cloud Stack and the SCS Logo remain in the OSBA.
   The companies also contribute financially, enabling the OSBA thus to hire staff
   to ensure effective coordination and meaningful evolution happens.
   Job offers are available on the [OSBA page](https://osb-alliance.de/jobs).
   The forum SCS-Standards has an own [web page](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org/).
2. The SCS Community continues to exist beyond the formalized standardization work in the
   forum SCS-Standards. The development of the of the software (last not least
   in the github organizations [SCS](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack)
   and [OSISM](https://github.com/OSISM)) happens through the existing and hopefully
   also new technology partners (see below for supporters), some also in the
   [ALASCA](https://alasca.cloud/) community.
   Coordination continues to happen via open interactions via
   [github](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack) and
   [OpenCoDE](https://gitlab.opencode.de/sovereigncloudstack),
   [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-community:matrix.org),
   [Mailing Lists](https://scs.sovereignit.de/mailman3/postorius/lists/),
   [nextcloud](https://scs.sovereignit.de/nextcloud/),
   [hedgedoc](https://input.scs.community/), and
   [video conferences](https://conf.scs.koeln:8443/).
   The [SCS Project Board](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0005-v1-project-governance)
   exercises governance over this and ensures transparency.
