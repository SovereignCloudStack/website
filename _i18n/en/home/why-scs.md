## Why yet another cloud stack?
{: .mb-3 }

Only Open Source guarantees interoperability, transparency and independence from legal claims of third parties and thus from political interference.  

By using the modular SCS Software stack, cloud providers can offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Container-as-a-Service without depending on other vendors.  

SCS is using and standardizing existing and proven Open Source components such as e.g. Kubernetes and does extend them where required. Federated cloud services are enabled this way, and users can leverage distributed cloud services from several SCS operators. European companies thus have options all the way from running it themselves or using one or several service providers and thus have 100% freedom of choice avoiding lock-in effects and dependencies from providers from foreign jurisdictions.  

By sharing and documenting best practices for operating such cloud stacks, the difficulty to provide high quality cloud services internally or publicly is vastly reduced.  

Our target: Anyone can benefit from the SCS software stack by using it -- and by contributing to the open source code, one will increase the value of [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/).
