We're associated partner of the GREEN-CIS macro project in the European IPCEI-CIS initiative. This growing alliance has set itself the goal of developing and building a virtual, sustainable cloud edge system operating as a single entity based on a decentralized, multi-provider ecosystem.

The collaboration among project partners with different competencies is essential to achieve the ambitious goal.</p>
