As part of the so-called GREEN-CIS consortium, short for “General Purpose Resilient and Secure Energy Efficient Computing Infrastructure Network”, we jointly apply for the European funding project “Important Project of Common European Interest - Cloud Infrastructure and Services” (IPCEI-CIS).
This growing alliance of a total of 28 industry and research partners has set itself the goal of developing and building a virtual, sustainable cloud edge system operating as a single entity based on a decentralized, multi-provider ecosystem.

	<p>The IPCEI-CIS is a great opportunity for Europe to work towards digital sovereignty. With GREEN-CIS we put forward a vision and a plan to achieve this sustainably, while guaranteeing the highest standards in terms of security, interoperability and quality of service. The collaboration among project partners with different competencies is essential to achieve the ambitious goal.</p>
