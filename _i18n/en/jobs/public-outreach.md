# Public Outreach Manager (f/m/d)
(Remote or Berlin-Centre)

The position is to be filled at the earliest possible date.

## About the project

The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open
source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually in
Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the
association is committed to anchoring the central importance of open source
software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public
consciousness. The OSB Alliance considers open source and open standards to be
essential foundations for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the
digital transformation and therefore the answer to one of the greatest
challenges of our time.

With the  Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is helping to
realise the goals of the German government's "Digital Strategy Germany" and the
European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud
infrastructure.

The project is being driven forward by a small team in the OSB Alliance with
funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
(BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to
this team, there are numerous developers from various companies and
institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by the
project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS
successful.

The SCS project defines and implements a complete, modular, secure and
open-source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack meets
high security standards and comes with tools and documentation that reduce the
need for specialised expertise to operate complex cloud and container
infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative development, documentation and
open provision of operational knowledge ("Open Operations") is a key building
block that is intended to simplify the operation of complex cloud
infrastructures at the highest level.

SCS can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and
deployed as a whole or in subcomponents depending on specific requirements. The
components can be certified automatically, which ensures compatibility with
other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of federable,
compatible clouds. 

SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X endeavour by serving as a reference for
development work and providing implementations that node providers can use in
whole or in part to create a federated, sovereign infrastructure that forms the
basis for a sovereign data ecosystem.
