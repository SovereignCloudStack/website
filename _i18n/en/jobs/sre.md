## About the project

The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open source economy, which in Germany together generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public consciousness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open standards as a compelling foundation for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the digital transformation and thus as an answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time.

With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing to the realisation of the goals of the German Federal Government's "Digital Strategy Germany" and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud infrastructure.

The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team, there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by the project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS successful.

The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure and open source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack includes software-defined storage and networking technology, operational tools for automated provisioning, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending, Identity and Access Management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer and a Container (Platform)-as-a-Service layer. The stack enables users (development teams) to create and control their own Kubernetes cluster via standardised APIs and provides standard building blocks that can be used to build and manage container applications. The stack meets high security standards and comes with tools and documentation that reduce the need for specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative development, documentation and open provision of operational knowledge ("Open Operations") is an essential building block to simplify the operation of complex cloud infrastructures at the highest level.

SCS can be used by cloud service providers as well as internal IT departments and can be deployed as a whole or in sub-components depending on specific needs. The components can be certified in an automated way, which ensures compatibility with other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of federatable, compatible clouds. 

SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X project by serving as a reference for development work and providing implementations that node providers can use as a whole or in parts to create a federated sovereign infrastructure that forms the basis for a sovereign data ecosystem.

## About the role

**As Site Reliability Engineer you will**

* ensure the performance of the cloud stack, especially with the goal of massively scalable deployments,
* guide the architecture development, building and maintenance of the core infrastructure for massively scalable deployments,
* build self-healing infrastructures with state-of-the-art tools and automation of recurring activities (CI/CD),
* monitor and optimise application performance and capacity planning,
* identify and resolve performance issues,
* implement the vision of systems that detect anomalies in the operating infrastructure, generate alarms and trigger autonomous traceable actions suitable to address the anomalies.
      
**We expect that you**

* have a university degree (Master's or equivalent) in computer science, informatics or similar fields or equivalent skills and experience,
* have experience in building and especially operating technologies, platforms and services relevant to the Sovereign Cloud Stack,
* ideally have knowledge of monitoring systems and machine analysis of patterns (e.g. machine learning methods),
* have the ability to methodically diagnose system, network and application problems,
* have several years of experience in open source development projects,
* have several years of experience in working on complex projects with agile management methods,
* have a strong sense of quality and 
* strong analytical skills.

**We offer**

* working in an open and inspiring environment, interacting with highly-skilled and driven individuals from the project, the partners and the relevant open-source communities,
* contributing to a project that will make a difference by being instrumental in a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond,
* to be a key part of a new project,
* working on cutting-edge open-source infrastructure technology, that will make the cloud world better,
* visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and the public at technology conferences,
* a lot of flexibility in organising your work and contributing to the internationally distributed team. This is a full-time position; however, part-time is also possible.
* an adequate compensation package.
