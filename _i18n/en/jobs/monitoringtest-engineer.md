For its [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/)
project funded by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs
and Climate Action (BMWK)](https://bmwk.de/), the
[Open Source Business Alliance -
Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. (OSB Alliance)](https://osb-alliance.de/) is looking for a
# Monitoring and Test Engineer (d/f/m)
(Remote or Berlin city centre)

We aim to fill this position as soon as possible.

The OSB Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale
Souveränität e.V. represents over 200 member companies in the
Open Source economy, which together generate more than 126 billion &euro;
annually in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user
organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance
of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign
society in public awareness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open
standards as a compelling basis for digital sovereignty, flexibility
and security in the digital transformation and thus as the answer to
one of the greatest challenges of our time.

With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing
to the realisation of the goals of the German government's Digital Strategy
2025 and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud
infrastructure.

The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year
funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The
advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team,
there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in
Europe who contribute to the project - some of them are funded by the project,
others because their employers are interested in making this project
successful.

The SCS project aims to standardise and implement a complete, modular, secure,
open-source software stack. It covers software-defined storage and networking,
operations tooling for automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting,
trending, identity and authorisation management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
layer, as well as a Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows users
(development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes cluster through
standardised APIs and delivers standard building blocks that can be used to
construct and manage container applications. This stack fulfills high security
standards and comes with tooling and documentation that reduce the need for
specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. SCS
can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and can be
deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed components from it. The
resulting infrastructure can be subjected to a certification process that
ensures strict compatibility with other SCS-based platforms, thus building a
network of federatable, compatible clouds. The SCS project also works on
establishing collaboration on the operations of infrastructure, jointly
building the skills and sharing the knowledge to successfully do so. This
idea is at the heart of the Open Operations movement that goes beyond SCS.

The SCS project contributes to the European Gaia-X effort by serving as a
reference for development work and enhancing it with an implementation that
node-providers can leverage as a whole or in parts to deliver federated
sovereign infrastructure, underpinning federation services (e.g. GXFS)
and a sovereign data ecosystem.

In this role, you will

* be part of a small central (remotely working) team that orchestrates the efforts to define,
	implement and validate (CI/CD) a stack of open source software,
* work with a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that contribute to the effort,
* have the role to focus on ensuring the quality of developed and deployed infrastructure
    software (both virtualization and container layer) by creating automated tests and
    monitoring infrastructure,
* guiding the process to define requirements and specifications for those systems
    with our development and CSP partners where needed,
* take the lead in implementing test and monitoring software, collaborating with
    and guiding engineers from our partners (especially our CSPs),
* ensuring that the software is well integrated into our continuous integration
    and continuous monitoring systems,
* supporting the maintenance of systems used for continuous integration and for
    monitoring, including data collection, trending, alarming, visualization,
* documenting the solutions and supporting our partners to use them,
* work with the relevant open source communities, typically part of the CNCF, LF,
    OIF, contribute back upstream as suitable and present at relevant conferences.

We expect that you

* have several years of hands-on experience with open source tooling commonly used
    to help operators with life cycle management, updating, validating, monitoring,
	metering, logging, securing such environments,
* have advanced experience how test frameworks work and know how to set these up
    and add tests to them,
* have experience with working with open source projects,
* are used to work in the open, exposing your work in progress to a your
     team mates and a broader community, accepting criticism and willing
     to work on defining and refining the chosen approach in interaction
     with the community, building (lazy) consensus,
* are familiar with open source development tools and platforms such as Git,
	 GitHub and the related workflows,
* have experience in using agile development methodologies,
* have strong analytical skills and a focus on high quality,
* are willing and able to present technology in meetings or on stage

We offer

* working in an open and inspiring environment, interacting with highly-skilled and
	driven individuals from the project, the partners and the relevant open-source communities
* contributing to a project that makes a difference by being instrumental for
	a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond
* being a key part of this important project
* working on open source infrastructure technology
* a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to
	the internationally distributed team. This is a full time position;
	we try to be flexible with part-time needs.
* getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the public
	on technology conferences
* an adequate compensation package
