## About the project

The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open source economy, which in Germany together generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public consciousness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open standards as a compelling foundation for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the digital transformation and thus as an answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time.

With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing to the realisation of the goals of the German Federal Government's "Digital Strategy Germany" and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud infrastructure.

The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team, there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by the project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS successful.

The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure and open source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack includes software-defined storage and networking technology, operational tools for automated provisioning, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending, Identity and Access Management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer and a Container (Platform)-as-a-Service layer. The stack enables users (development teams) to create and control their own Kubernetes cluster via standardised APIs and provides standard building blocks that can be used to build and manage container applications. The stack meets high security standards and comes with tools and documentation that reduce the need for specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative development, documentation and open provision of operational knowledge ("Open Operations") is an essential building block to simplify the operation of complex cloud infrastructures at the highest level.

SCS can be used by cloud service providers as well as internal IT departments and can be deployed as a whole or in sub-components depending on specific needs. The components can be certified in an automated way, which ensures compatibility with other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of federatable, compatible clouds. 

SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X project by serving as a reference for development work and providing implementations that node providers can use as a whole or in parts to create a federated sovereign infrastructure that forms the basis for a sovereign data ecosystem.
