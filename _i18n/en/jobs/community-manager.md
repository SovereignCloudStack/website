The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is looking for a
# SCS Community Manager

We aim to fill this position by Jul 2021.

The Project is driven by a small team in the
[OSB Alliance](https://osb-alliance.com) with
multi-year funding from the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi).
This job offering is for hiring into this team. In addition to this
team there are numerous engineers from various companies contributing
to the project -- some of them paid through the project funding,
some of them because their employer is interested in making this
project successful.

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is aiming to define and
implement a complete, modular, secure, open-source software stack. It
covers software-defined storage and networking, operations tooling for
automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending,
identity and authorization management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
layer, as well as Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows
users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes
cluster through standardized APIs and delivers standard building
blocks used to construct and manage container applications. This
stack fulfills high security standards and comes with tooling and
documentation that reduces the amount of specialized expertise
required to run complex cloud and container infrastructure. SCS can
be used by cloud service providers and internal IT teams alike and it
can be deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed
components from it. The end result can be subjected to a
certification process, ensuring strict compatibility with other SCS
based platforms, thus building a network of federatable compatible
clouds.

The SCS project is contributing to the pan-european GAIA-X effort,
serving as reference for development work and enhancing
it with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole
or in parts to deliver federated sovereign infrastructure, underpinning
a sovereign data ecosystem.
