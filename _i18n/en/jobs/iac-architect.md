For its [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/)
project funded by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)](https://bmwi.de/), the
[Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V. (OSB Alliance)](https://osb-alliance.de/)
is looking for a
# SCS Infra-as-Code Architect (d/f/m)
(Remote or Berlin city centre)

*The position is to be filled as soon as possible.*

## About the project

The Open Source Business Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. (OSB Alliance) represents more than 200 member companies of the open
source economy, which in Germany together generate more than 126 billion Euros
annually. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the
association works to anchor the central importance of open source software and
open standards for a digitally sovereign society in the public consciousness.
The OSB Alliance sees open source and open standards as a compelling foundation
for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the digital transformation
and thus as an answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time.

With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing
to the realisation of the goals of the German Federal Government's "Digital
Strategy Germany" and the European Gaia-X project by developing a
next-generation open cloud infrastructure.

The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year
funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate
Action (BMWK). The advertised position is part of this central team. In
addition to this team, there are numerous developers from different companies
and institutions in Europe who contribute to SCS - some of them are funded by
the project, others because their employers are interested in making SCS
successful.

The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure and
open source software stack and corresponding open standards. The stack includes
software-defined storage and networking technology, operational tools for
automated provisioning, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending, Identity and
Access Management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer and a Container
(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. The stack enables users (development teams) to
create and control their own Kubernetes cluster via standardised APIs and
provides standard building blocks that can be used to build and manage
container applications. The stack meets high security standards and comes with
tools and documentation that reduce the need for specialised expertise to run
complex cloud and container infrastructures. The systematic, collaborative
development, documentation and open provision of operational knowledge ("Open
Operations") is an essential building block to simplify the operation of
complex cloud infrastructures at the highest level.

SCS can be used by cloud service providers as well as internal IT departments
and can be deployed as a whole or in sub-components depending on specific
needs. The components can be certified in an automated way, which ensures
compatibility with other SCS-based platforms and thus establishes a network of
federatable, compatible clouds. 

SCS contributes to the European Gaia-X project by serving as a reference for
development work and providing implementations that node providers can use as a
whole or in parts to create a federated sovereign infrastructure that forms the
basis for a sovereign data ecosystem.

## About the role

**As a Infra-as-Code Architect, you will**

* drive efforts to ensure a consistent description of SCS APIs exists,
* work on tooling that uses these APIs to provide a consistent and convenient user experience,
* ensure that there is good documentation for these tools,
* ensure that these are automatically tested and contribute to our test infrastructure (based on zuul) as needed,
* contribute to improve transparency and security on our supply chain,
* contribute to expose our federation concepts consistently to users,
* work with the upstream communities to ensure that our work is aligned with them and thus contributes to reduce the fragmentation,
* interact with operators and users to ensure that our work reflects their needs,
* collaborate closely with the SCS project team and the contractors of the SCS project.

**We expect you to have**

* practical experience in using OpenStack cloud computing platforms,
* hands-on experience developing code for OpenStack services and/or tooling,
* a track record of successfully working with and contributing to upstream Open Source communities,
* an openness to study the logic of kubernetes APIs and API extensions,
* experience with the continuous integration and automation framework zuul,
* familiarity with open source development tools and platforms such as Git, Gerrit, GitHub and the associated workflows,
* skills to speak and write English fluently and at least basic skills in German.

**It would be great - but not mandatory - if you**

* are used to working openly, sharing your ongoing work with a broad community, accepting constructive criticism, and are willing to work on defining and refining your chosen approach in interaction with the community and to reach (what is known as) „lazy consensus“,
* are also willing to study and understand the work of others and supporting them with constructive feedback,
* have an understanding of the needs of developers of cloud-native applications.

**We offer**

* work in an open and inspiring environment where you can collaborate with highly skilled and dedicated people from the project, partners and relevant open source communities worldwide,
* the opportunity to contribute to a project that aims to be instrumental to a vibrant ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond,
* to be able to work on modern open source infrastructure technology,
* a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to the internationally distributed team. This is a full-time position; however, part-time is not excluded.
* the ability to work openly with upstream communities and contribute to them along the goals of the SCS project,
* reasonable compensation.
