For its [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/)
project funded by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs 
and Energy (BMWi)](https://bmwi.de/), the
[Open Source Business Alliance -
Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität
e.V. (OSB Alliance)](https://osb-alliance.de/) is looking for a
# Knowledge Management Engineer (d/f/m)
(Remote or Berlin city centre)

We aim to fill this position as soon as possible.

The OSB Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale
Souveränität e.V. represents over 170 member companies in the
Open Source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion &euro;
annually in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user
organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance
of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign
society in public awareness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open
standards as a compelling basis for digital sovereignty, flexibility
and security in the digital transformation and thus as the answer to
one of the greatest challenges of our time.

With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing
to the realisation of the goals of the German government's Digital Strategy
2025 and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud
infrastructure.

The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year
funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The
advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team,
there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in
Europe who contribute to the project - some of them are funded by the project,
others because their employers are interested in making this project
successful.

The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure,
open-source software stack. It covers software-defined storage and networking,
operations tooling for automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting,
trending, identity and authorisation management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
layer, as well as a Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows users
(development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes cluster through
standardised APIs and delivers standard building blocks that can be used to
construct and manage container applications. This stack fulfills high security
standards and comes with tooling and documentation that reduce the need for
specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. SCS
can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and can be
deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed components from it. The
resulting infrastructure can be subjected to a certification process that
ensures strict compatibility with other SCS-based platforms, thus building a
network of federatable, compatible clouds.

The SCS project contributes to the European Gaia-X effort by serving as a
reference for development work and enhancing it with an implementation that
node-providers can leverage as a whole or in parts to deliver federated
sovereign infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data ecosystem.

In this role, you will

* be part of the (fully remote) OSB Alliance team that leads and organizes the
  efforts to define, implement, validate (CI/CD), document and
  disseminate the SCS open source software stack
* orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that
  contribute to the effort
* interact closely with upstream communities and downstream providers
* create relationships, structure and technology to captience, including
  situations when operational issues happen
* design processes to encourage contributions to our knowledge base,
  collecting input also from people not involved in the SCS on a daily
  basis.
* structure the processes to document collected experience, validate it
  and make it available in ways that are easy to consume for cloud
  operators, developers and users.

We expect that you

* have a good overview over open source system software technology
* have hands-on experience with structuring technical documentation and
  knowledge management systems
* know how to work with knowledgable individuals to efficiently collect
  and document information and experience from them
* have been in roles where you had responsibility for designing
  documentation or publications and ideally had leadership roles
  for teams that were tasked with such responsibilities
* have worked with open source communities with diverse background
* understand agile development methodologies
* are willing and able to present processes and technology

We offer

* working in an open and inspiring environment, in a team of highly
  motivated experts, with top-level industry partners, relevant open
  source communities and scientists
* contributing to a project that will make a difference for Digital
  Sovereignty by being instrumental for a vivid ecosystem of federated
  infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond
* being a key part of a new project
* working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology
* a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to
  the internationally distributed team. This is an 80% position;
  we try to be flexible with different part-time needs.
* getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the
  public on technology conferences
* an adequate compensation package.
