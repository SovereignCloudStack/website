This website uses log files to identify problems with the site and to monitor

No web analytics is done.

The raw log files are not shared with anyone; however within the first week, we 
have access to the log files to solve technical problems. In exceptional cases
stripped down copies of the log files may be stored for longer to analyze
problems spanning more than a week. These copies are deleted as soon as the
problem has been solved.
