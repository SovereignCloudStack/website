# Data Protection Statement

This web page serves to provide information about the Sovereign Cloud Stack
project at the [Open Source Business Alliance e.V.](https://osb-alliance.de/).

If people get in touch with us via eMail, we will store those eMails, respond
to them etc.  No data is ever shared with external parties unless explicitly
requested by the correspondent.

This website uses log files to identify problems with the site and to monitor
traffic. The log files contain traces of which pages have been accessed when 
from which IP address. The raw log files are kept for a week and are then deleted. 

The raw log files are not shared with anyone; however within the first week, we 
have access to the log files to solve technical problems. In exceptional cases
stripped down copies of the log files may be stored for longer to analyze
problems spanning more than a week. These copies are deleted as soon as the
problem has been solved.

## Matomo Analytics
Based on our legitimate interest under Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f. GDPR, we use "Matomo"
to analyze and optimize the traffic on this website. This is an open source tool
for web analysis.

We have configured Matomo so that it does not set any cookies. Your IP address 
will be anonymized immediately. Thus, you also remain anonymous as a user. If you
do not want your visits of our website to be analyzed, you can opt-out of storage
and usage of this data below. Alternatively, you can activate the _Do-Not-Track_
setting of your browser, which is honored by our Matomo installation.

By accessing our website, the following data will be stored:

- 2 bytes of the user's IP address  
- The accessed pages of our website  
- The website from which the user has been referred to our website  
- The websites that are accessed from our website  
- The total time spent on our website  
- The frequency with which our website is accessed

The data collected by the Matomo is processed and stored exclusively on servers
maintained by employees of the SCS project. We will not share any of the data 
collected with third parties.
