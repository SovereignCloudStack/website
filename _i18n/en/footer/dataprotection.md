This website uses log files to identify problems with the site and to monitor

No web analytics is done.

The raw log files are not shared with anyone; however within the first week, we

stripped down copies of the log files may be stored for longer to analyze
problems spanning more than a week. These copies are deleted as soon as the
problem has been solved.
