### Storage Technology
The storage technology shall receive security enhancements. All data that ends up on permanent storage should be encrypted to ensure that stolen (or not properly decomissioned) storage media do not put the confidentiality of data at risk. The tenant separation shall be audited to enable statements and respective certifications. This needs to be assured through continuous tests, such that updates are possible without creating any security risks or risks for losing the certification.For some work loads where low latency write handling is required (e.g. databases), an evalation of possibilities to achieve better write latency will be evaluated. It should become possible to have several performance classes, which need to be characterized and appropriately be managed. For high security environments, tenant-specific storage clusters might be needed; createing a way to automatically provision and manage these is part of this job.
