## Lot 12

### Cloud/Containerplatform Health Monitoring

The subject of the invitation to tender is a framework agreement with a company
for programming and other services for the development, documentation,
validation integration and initially also operation of open source software 
to automatically check and monitor the availability, responsiveness and
correct functioning of Sovereign Cloud Stack environments.

The continuous checking and monitoring of the platform allows to detect and
observe anomalies in the platform behavior, especially when changes are being
applied to the platform (e.g. by updates). With the OpenStack Health Monitor,
a blueprint already exists for the IaaS reference implementation of Sovereign
Cloud Stack and shows how such checking in form of blackbox monitoring could
look like.

The focus of this tender lot is to use this blueprint as well as other
already evaluated approaches to create a tool set that is modular and can
be well-maintained to perform behavior-driven monitoring using scenario
testing approaches. The first step would be to cover the IaaS layer.
The architecture however should enable covering other layers as well,
last not least using container workloads to monitor the container layer.
