# Public tenders
Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a network of existing and future providers of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to lose control over the technology and the data.

The Open Source Business Alliance is building a growing team that will manage and coordinate standardisation, software integration and the development of this network. A community of employees from participating and interested companies has already been formed around this team, who are working in particular on the goals that are important for their own environments.

Important building blocks will be awarded to companies through open tenders, which will be continously published on this page.
The subject of the tenders are usually framework agreements on programming and other services.
Please note that any questions regarding the public tenders must mandatorily be posted via the linked contracting portal.
Please refrain from addressing the project team directly.
