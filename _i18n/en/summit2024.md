# 2. Sovereign Cloud Stack Summit May 14, 2024 in Berlin

Dear friends of SCS and interested observers,

the SCS community has grown strongly in the past year, many new production environments based on SCS have been created and on March 20 we were able to publish the 6th release as planned.
Join us in Berlin when SCS users from a wide range of application areas share their experiences and tell us why they have opted for digitally sovereign cloud technology with SCS and find out what the future of the SCS project will look like.

* Ernst Stöckl-Pukall, Head of the Department for Digitalization and Industry 4.0 at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection, will open the event with a welcome address.

* Some of our largest partners and cloud service providers will talk about why they have chosen SCS as their technology - and what role implementation and certification have played in this. We are looking forward to impulses from Christian Schmitz, Director Open Source at Plusserver GmbH, and Jens Plogsties, CTO of Syseleven GmbH, among others.

* Viola Heeger from Tagesspiegel will discuss with Ulrich Ahle, CEO of Gaia-X, and Jörg Kremer, Head of Federal IT Architecture Management at FITKO, the importance of standards and standardized technology for the federability of digitization projects in public administration and the private sector in a European context.
* Dirk Schrödter, Minister for Digitization and Head of the State Chancellery of Schleswig-Holstein, will explain why "Open Source First" applies in the northernmost federal state and why SCS is the basis for cloud applications, such as the Call for Concepts for the state program Open Innovations (DigitalHub.SH).
* The product owners of SCS will present and explain various technical aspects and components of SCS.
* Finally, the Chairman of the OSB Alliance and CEO of Univention GmbH, Peter Ganten, will give an outlook on the future of SCS.
