# Community Members

One goal of Sovereign Cloud Stack is to foster an vivid ecosystem that facilitates
the development and operation of fully open, federated and compatible platforms.

The ability to communicate, share and discuss is an important factor to be successful as a community.

On this page you will find the list of contributors who have decided to <a href="/2023/01/27/community-profiles/">publish</a> their profile here and
we are of course happy to welcome anyone who decides to do so.

The SCS project welcomes anyone who would like to share individual information (e.g. just the Matrix account) or extensive information.

A general overview of all people involved in the project can be found in the [member list](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/people
) of the Github organization.
