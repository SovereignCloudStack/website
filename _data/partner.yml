  description: "With its Accelerate program, Syself follows a holistic approach to building European and sovereign cloud infrastructure. Syself targets both start-ups, where everything has to be built from scratch, as well as established companies having to modernize their infrastructure. Syself builds Kubernetes clusters managed by Cluster API. The focus lies on effectively managing both clusters and containerized applications (CI/CD, GitOps with Helm/Helmfile)."
  offerings: 
    kubernetes: "All Kubernetes-related topics, e.g. setting up Kubernetes clusters with Cluster API on SCS-compliant clouds, management of Kubernetes cluster with focus on GitOps, training and consulting."

  description: "StackHPC is one of the leading OpenStack consultancies working with research institutions worldwide. Formed in 2016, StackHPC has established a formidable reputation with eminent organisations developing OpenStack for their benefit and enabling OpenStack client teams to support their mission critical operations. StackHPC is a committed member of the Open Infrastructure Foundation and SCS Community.
Our focus is on the Research or Scientific Computing landscape where the demands of high performance computing can place exacting requirements on the underlying configuration of the infrastructure, especially when dealing with the software-defined complexities of modern on-premise cloud infrastructure, together with extending this model to hybrid cloud environments. While Research Computing remains our focus, we also support clients across the industrial, retail and financial sectors who share a similar mission in performance."
  offerings:
    installation: "We provide design and installation services based around the deployment of OpenStack infrastructure using Kolla-Ansible and a rigorous release methodology for CI/CD day 1 and day 2 operations. OpenStack systems can range from traditional virtualised infrastructure to large-scale bare metal systems."
    training: "We offer workshops for clients to build up the local skill set, capabilities and confidence in order to help teams tasked with OpenStack administration become effective and self-sustaining as quickly as possible. More details can be found <a href='https://www.stackhpc.com/pages/workshops.html'>here</a>."
    support: "We provide 3rd-level support to our OpenStack and Ceph clients with built-in upgrades to the latest OpenStack releases."
