description: "23 Technologies is a global first team working to bring cloud native technologies to the industry. We are actively working on Gaia-X, Catena-X, Structura-X, and are committed to a data-sovereign Europe, sustainable IT solutions and open-source software development. Our solutions are completely modular and can be used independently of each other. Only without inflexible integration is it really possible to avoid vendor lock-ins. Within the scope of the research & development project SDM4FZI (Software-defined Manufacturing f√ºr die Fahrzeug- und Zulieferindustrie) we work on highly versatile production systems with simultaneous control of complexity through virtualization and containerization."
