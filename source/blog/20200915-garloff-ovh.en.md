# Kurt Garloff: Some comments on the OVH T-Systems deal

SCS is a collaboration of many companies from the industrial and ICT sector as well
as public institutions in a GAIA-X working package, tackling the standardization
and implementation of a common stack for a cloud- and container platform, providing
an option for a sovereign underpinning for higher-level services in the GAIA-X project.
It's relevant for our success that we are using jointly defined standards to overcome
the currect fragmentation in the market (outside of hyperscalers) and create a
well-established platform that allows customers and developers to freely combine
service providers and also exchange them should the need arise.

Two of our SCS partners, OVH and T-Systems, announced yesterday that they will
collaborate closely even beyond the joint work in SCS and GAIA-X and the collaboration
will cover hardware, data centers, operations and the software stack.

I have been asked how that interacts with SCS and I have reached out to both partners
to ensure there is no change in course how they work with us. And there is not.

I really congratulate OVH and T-Systems on this deal!
It's great to see them collaborate even beyond the scope of GAIA-X.
It will help those two large providers to gain speed in implementing SCS
and in establishing a truly open alternative in the market.
