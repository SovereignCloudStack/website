        <h1>SCS Community Manager</h1>
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is
	  aiming to define a complete, modular, secure,
	  open-source software stack covering software-defined storage and
	  networking, operations tooling for automated deployment, logging,
	  monitoring, alerting, trending, identity and authorization management,
	  an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, as well as
	  Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. The latter should allow
	  users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes
	  cluster through standardized APIs and should deliver standard
	  building blocks used to construct and manage container applications.
	  The thus defined stack fulfills high security standards and comes
	  with tooling and documentation that reduces the amount of specialized
	  expertise required to run complex cloud and container infrastructure.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	  The project is contributing to the GAIA-X effort, enhancing 
	  GAIA-X with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole
	  or in parts to deliver federated sovereign
	  infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data
	  ecosystem. The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance
	  with funding from the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi).
	  This job offering is for hiring into this team. In addition to this
	  team there are numerous engineers from various companies contributing
	  to the project -- some of them paid through the project funding,
	  some of them because their employer is interested in making this
	  project successful.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	 The SCS Project is looking for a <B>Community Manager</B>.
	 We aim to fill this position by Aug 1, 2021. We have secured funding until the
	 end of Aug, 2024 but have ideas how we can sustain the project along with key
	 roles beyond 2024.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	 In this role, you will
	<ul><li>be part of a small central team that orchestrates the efforts to define, 
		implement and validate (CI/CD) a stack of open source software</li>
	<li>orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that
		contribute to the effort</li>
	<li>work intensely with upstream communities and downstream providers</li>
	<li>create relationships, structure and technology to capture the experience
		that exists and that is being build up in the process of developing
		and using SCS</li>
	<li>support the process of creating a culture that allows for sharing such
		experience, last not least also creating transparency when
		operational issues happen</li>
	<li>design processes that allow to tap into the knowledge of otherwise
		not involved individuals and leverage this to document
		knowledge and/or have input for quality assurance and improvement
		of documentation</li>
	<li>support the process to get the collected experience in a usable
		and structured format</li>
	<li>design and implement the technical processes to ensure the information
		is accessible and can be found and used</li>
	</ul></p>
        <p class="lead">
	 We expect that you <ul>
	 <li>have a good overview over open source system software technology</li>
	 <li>have hands-on experience with structuring technical documentation
		and knowledge management systems</li>
	 <li>know how to work with knowledgable individuals to efficiently extract
		and document information</li>
	 <li>have been in roles where you had responsibility for designing
		 documentation or publications and ideally had leadership roles
		 for teams that were tasked with such responsibilities</li>
	 <li>have worked with open source communities with diverse background</li>
	 <li>understand agile development methodologies</li>
	 <li>are willing and able to present processes and technology on stage or in meetings</li>
	 </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
	We offer <ul>
	<li>working in an open and inspiring environment, interacting with highly-skilled and 
		driven individuals from the project, the partners and the relevant open-source communities</li>
	<li>contributing to a project that will make a difference by being instrumental for
		a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond</li>
	<li>being a key part of a new project</li>
	<li>working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology</li>
	<li>getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the public 
		on technology conferences</li>
	<li>an adequate compensation package</li>
	</ul>
