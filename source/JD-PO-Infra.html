        <h1>SCS Product Owner IaaS and Operations</h1>
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is
	  aiming to define a complete, modular, secure,
	  open-source software stack covering software-defined storage and
	  networking, operations tooling for automated deployment, logging,
	  monitoring, alerting, trending, identity and authorization management,
	  an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, as well as
	  Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. The latter should allow
	  users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes
	  cluster through standardized APIs and should deliver standard
	  building blocks used to construct and manage container applications.
	  The thus defined stack fulfills high security standards and comes
	  with tooling and documentation that reduces the amount of specialized
	  expertise required to run complex cloud and container infrastructure.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	  The project is contributing to the GAIA-X effort, enhancing 
	  GAIA-X with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole
	  or in parts to deliver federated sovereign
	  infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data
	  ecosystem. The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance
	  with funding from the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi).
	  This job offering is for hiring into this team. In addition to this
	  team there are numerous engineers from various companies contributing
	  to the project -- some of them paid through the project funding,
	  some of them because their employer is interested in making this
	  project successful.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	 The SCS Project is looking for a <B>Product Owner IaaS and Operations</B>.
	 We aim to fill this position by Jun 1, 2021. We have secured funding until the
	 end of Aug, 2024 but have ideas how we can sustain the project along with key
	 roles beyond 2024.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	 In this role, you will
	<ul><li>be part of a small central team that orchestrates the efforts to define, 
		implement and validate (CI/CD) a stack of open source software</li>
	<li>orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that contribute to the effort</li>
	<li>have the role to work with stakeholders to understand the requirements, see how they can fit
	    together in a coherent technical architecture and collect and prioritize the backlog</li>
	<li>ensure that the needed research is performed to be able to take the right architectural
	    decisions and document them</li>
	<li>work with the developers in the development team as product owner, defining the
	    user stories and acceptance criteria together and ultimately be responsible
	    to drive the implementation efforts to completion.</li>
	<li>ensure that the work results in software with all automation, configuration
	    and tests for continuous automated deployment and testing</li>
	<li>work with the relevant open source communities, typically part of the OIF
	    and the LF</li>
	</ul></p>
        <p class="lead">
	 We expect that you <ul>
	 <li>have hands-on experience with Open Source Operating Systems, Virtualization,
		 and OpenStack, as well as standard tools to do configuration management
		 and monitoring tools.</li>
	 <li>are experienced not just using such environments, but being in a 
		 responsible position to plan, deploy and operate them</li>
	 <li>are familiar with cloud workloads on top of IaaS platforms and know
		 how Container platforms can be automated on top of OpenStack IaaS.</li>
	 <li>have been in leadership roles in engineering organizations</li>
	 <li>are connected to the relevant open source communities</li>
	 <li>are used to work in the open, exposing your work in progress to a broad 
		 community, accepting criticism and willing to work on defining and refining 
		 the chosen approach in interaction with the community, building (lazy) consensus</li>
	 <li>are familiar with open source development tools and platforms such as Git,
		 GitHub and the related workflows</li>
	 <li>are experienced in using deployment automation and configuration management tooling
		 such as Ansible and Terraform</li>
	 <li>have experience in using agile development methodologies</li>
	 <li>are willing and able to present complex technology on stage or in meetings</li>
	 </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
	We offer <ul>
	<li>working in an open and inspiring environment, interacting with highly-skilled and 
		driven individuals from the project, the partners and the relevant open-source communities</li>
	<li>contributing to a project that will make a difference by being instrumental for
		a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond</li>
	<li>being a key part of a new project</li>
	<li>working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology</li>
	<li>getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the public 
		on technology conferences</li>
	<li>an adequate compensation package</li>
	</ul>
