	For its <a href="https://scs.community/"> Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)</a>
	project funded by the <a href="https://bmwi.de">German Federal Ministry
	for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)</a>, the
	<a href="https://osb-alliance.com/">Open Source Business Alliance -
	Bundesverband f&uuml;r digitale Souver&auml;nit&auml;t
	e.V. (OSB Alliance)</a> is looking for a
	<h1>Knowledge Management Engineer (d/f/m)</h1>
	(Home office or Berlin city centre).</p>
	<p class="lead">
	We aim to fill this position as soon as possible, subject to funding approval.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	The OSB Alliance - Bundesverband f&uuml;r digitale
	Souver&auml;nit&auml;t e.V. represents over 170 member companies in the
	Open Source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion &euro;
	annually in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user
	organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance
	of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign
	society in public awareness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open
	standards as a compelling basis for digital sovereignty, flexibility
	and security in the digital transformation and thus as the answer to
	one of the greatest challenges of our time.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing
	to the realisation of the goals of the German government's Digital Strategy
	2025 and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud
	infrastructure.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year
	funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The
	advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team,
	there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in
	Europe who contribute to the project - some of them are funded by the project,
	others because their employers are interested in making this project
	successful.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure,
	open-source software stack. It covers software-defined storage and networking,
	operations tooling for automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting,
	trending, identity and authorisation management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
	layer, as well as a Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows users
	(development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes cluster through
	standardised APIs and delivers standard building blocks that can be used to
	construct and manage container applications. This stack fulfills high security
	standards and comes with tooling and documentation that reduce the need for
	specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. SCS
	can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and can be
	deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed components from it. The
	resulting infrastructure can be subjected to a certification process that
	ensures strict compatibility with other SCS-based platforms, thus building a
	network of federatable, compatible clouds.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	The SCS project contributes to the European Gaia-X effort by serving as a
	reference for development work and enhancing it with an implementation that
	node-providers can leverage as a whole or in parts to deliver federated
	sovereign infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data ecosystem.</p>
	<p class="lead">
	In this role, you will
	<ul>
	<li>be part of the OSB Alliance team that leads and organizes the
	 efforts to define, implement, validate (CI/CD), document and
	 disseminate the SCS open source software stack</li>
	<li>orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that
	 contribute to the effort</li>
	<li>interact closely with upstream communities and downstream providers</li>
	<li>create relationships, structure and technology to captience, including
	 situations when operational issues happen</li>
	<li>design processes to encourage contributions to our knowledge base,
	 collecting input also from people not involved in the SCS on a daily
	 basis.</li>
	<li>structure the processes to document collected experience, validate it
	 and make it available in ways that are easy to consume for cloud
	 operators, developers and users.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p class="lead">
	We expect that you
	<ul>
	<li>have a good overview over open source system software technology</li>
	<li>have hands-on experience with structuring technical documentation and
	 knowledge management systems</li>
	<li>know how to work with knowledgable individuals to efficiently collect
	 and document information and experience from them</li>
	<li>have been in roles where you had responsibility for designing
	 documentation or publications and ideally had leadership roles
	 for teams that were tasked with such responsibilities</li>
	<li>have worked with open source communities with diverse background</li>
	<li>understand agile development methodologies</li>
	<li>are willing and able to present processes and technology</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p class="lead">
	We offer
	<ul>
	<li>working in an open and inspiring environment, in a team of highly
	 motivated experts, with top-level industry partners, relevant open
	 source communities and scientists</li>
	<li>contributing to a project that will make a difference for Digital
	 Sovereignty by being instrumental for a vivid ecosystem of federated
	 infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond</li>
	<li>being a key part of a new project</li>
	<li>working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology</li>
	<li>a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to
	 the internationally distributed team. This is an 80% position;
	 we try to be flexible with different part-time needs.</li>
	<li>getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the
	 public on technology conferences</li>
	<li>an adequate compensation package.</li>
	</ul></p>
