        <h1>SCS Community Manager</h1>
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is looking for a
	  <b> Community Manager</b>.<br/>
	  <!--Information &amp; Documentation Manager-->
	  We aim to fill this position by Jul 2021.
	  The Project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with
	  multi-year funding from the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi).
	  This job offering is for hiring into this team. In addition to this
	  team there are numerous engineers from various companies contributing
	  to the project -- some of them paid through the project funding,
	  some of them because their employer is interested in making this
	  project successful.</p>
	<!--
	  We have secured funding until the
	  end of Aug, 2024 and have ideas how we can sustain the project along with key
	  roles beyond 2024.</p>-->
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is aiming to define and
	  implement a complete, modular, secure, open-source software stack. It
	  covers software-defined storage and networking, operations tooling for
	  automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending,
	  identity and authorization management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
	  layer, as well as Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows
	  users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes
	  cluster through standardized APIs and delivers standard building
	  blocks used to construct and manage container applications. This
	  stack fulfills high security standards and comes with tooling and
	  documentation that reduces the amount of specialized expertise
	  required to run complex cloud and container infrastructure. SCS can
	  be used by cloud service providers and internal IT teams alike and it
	  can be deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed
	  components from it. The end result can be subjected to a
	  certification process, ensuring strict compatibility with other SCS
	  based platforms, thus building a network of federatable compatible
	  clouds.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	  The SCS project is contributing to the pan-european GAIA-X effort,
	  serving as reference for development work and enhancing
	  it with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole
	  or in parts to deliver federated sovereign infrastructure, underpinning
	  a sovereign data ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	 In this role, you will
	<ul><li>be part of a small central team that orchestrates the efforts to define, 
		implement and validate (CI/CD) a stack of open source software</li>

		 discussions with diverse communities</li>
	 <li>are used to very open and transparent communication</li>
	 </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
	We offer <ul>
	<li>working in an open and inspiring environment, interacting with highly-skilled and 
		driven individuals from the project, the partners and the relevant open-source communities</li>
	<li>contributing to a project that will make a difference by being instrumental for
		a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond</li>
