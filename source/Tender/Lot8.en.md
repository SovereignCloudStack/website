### Federation
Beyond compatibility and interoperability, we need federation of the user identity and role/privilege management (IAM=Identity & Access Management) and secure network connections for the federation of infrastructure from several providers. (The network connections are dealt with in the network chapter, not here.) For IAM, standard protocols such as Open ID Connect and SAML shall be supporting and a flexible mapping of user attributes to roles / privileges of users shall be made possible. Next to classical federation approaches, the distributed ID (DID) approach that is being prominently discussed in Gaia-X shall be evaluated and taken into account here.
