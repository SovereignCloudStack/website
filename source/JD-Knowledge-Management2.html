        <h1>SCS Knowledge Management Engineer</h1>
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is looking for a 
	  <B> Knowledge Management Engineer</B>.
	  <!--Information &amp; Documentation Manager-->
	  We aim to fill this position by Mar 2021.
	  The Project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with
	  multi-year funding from the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi).
	  This job offering is for hiring into this team. In addition to this
	  team there are numerous engineers from various companies contributing
	  to the project -- some of them paid through the project funding,
	  some of them because their employer is interested in making this
	  project successful.</p>
	<!-- 
	  We have secured funding until the
	  end of Aug, 2024 and have ideas how we can sustain the project along with key
	  roles beyond 2024.</p>-->
        <p class="lead">
	  The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) Project is aiming to define a
	  complete, modular, secure, open-source software stack. It covers
	  software-defined storage and networking, operations tooling for
	  automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending,
	  identity and authorization management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
	  layer, as well as Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows
	  users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes
	  cluster through standardized APIs and delivers standard building
	  blocks used to construct and manage container applications.  This
	  stack fulfills high security standards and comes with tooling and
	  documentation that reduces the amount of specialized expertise
	  required to run complex cloud and container infrastructure.  SCS can
	  be used by cloud service providers and internal IT teams alike and it
	  can be deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed
	  components from it. The end result can be subjected to a
	  certification process, ensuring strict compatibility with other SCS
	  based platforms, thus building a network of federatable compatible
	  clouds.</p>
        <p class="lead">
	  The SCS project is contributing to the pan-european GAIA-X effort,
	  serving as reference for development work and enhancing
	  it with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole
	  or in parts to deliver federated sovereign infrastructure, underpinning
	  a sovereign data ecosystem.
        <p class="lead">
	 In this role, you will
	<ul><li>be part of a small central team that leads and organizes the efforts
		to define, implement and validate (CI/CD) the SCS open source
		software stack</li>
	<li>orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that
		contribute to the effort</li>
	<li>interact closely with upstream communities and downstream providers</li>
	<li>create relationships, structure and technology to capture the experience
		that exists and that is being build up in the process of developing
		and using SCS</li>
	<li>contribute to the process of creating a culture that allows for sharing
		such experience, including situations when operational issues
		happen</li>
	<li>design processes to encourage contributions to our knowledge base,
		collecting input also from people not involved in the SCS
		on a daily basis.</li>
	<li>structure the processes to document collected experience, validate it
		and make it available in ways that are easy to consume for cloud
		operators, developers and users.</li>
	</ul></p>
        <p class="lead">
	 We expect that you <ul>
	 <li>have a good overview over open source system software technology</li>
	 <li>have hands-on experience with structuring technical documentation
		and knowledge management systems</li>
	 <li>know how to work with knowledgable individuals to efficiently collect
		 and document information and experience from them</li>
	 <li>have been in roles where you had responsibility for designing
		 documentation or publications and ideally had leadership roles
		 for teams that were tasked with such responsibilities</li>
	 <li>have worked with open source communities with diverse background</li>
	 <li>understand agile development methodologies</li>
	 <li>are willing and able to present processes and technology on stage or in meetings</li>
	 </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
	We offer <ul>
	<li>working in an open and inspiring environment, in a team of highly
		motivated experts, with top-level industry partners, relevant open
		source communities and scientists</li>
	<li>contributing to a project that will make a difference for Digital Sovereignty
		by being instrumental for a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure
		providers in Europe and beyond</li>
	<li>being a key part of a new project</li>
	<li>working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology</li>
	<li>getting visibility by presenting the project to stakeholders and to the public 
		on technology conferences</li>
	<li>an adequate compensation package</li>
	</ul>
