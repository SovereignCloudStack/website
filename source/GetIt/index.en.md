# Get Sovereign Cloud Stack

## Getting SCS

Sovereign Cloud Stack is fully Open Source -- we develop it in an open
development process in an open community. We follow the
[Four Opens](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/) of the Open Infrastructure
Community. We work closely with the upstream projects from the
[Open Infrastructure Foundation](https://openinfra.dev/), the
[Cloud Native Compute Foundation](https://cncf.io/) and other open
source communities. Most of our source code comes from these
communities -- when we improve, amend, change things, we seek the
contact with these communities to contribute our changes back.

We use [github](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/) to
manage the code we are using -- our own code mainly
consists of the automation and integration that glues the used
upstream projects together in a consistent and manageable way.
Add documentation and CI tests to the mix.

To install your own SCS code, so you can study, test, change it
and contribute to it, we refer you to our
[github Docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/)
repository.

## SCS and OSISM

For the base layers, we heavily build on top of the
[Open Source Infrastructure and Service Manager](https://osism.tech/) (OSISM)
project.

## Contributing

We have created a 
[contributor guide](https://scs.community/docs/contributor/)
that documents some of policies and processes we have
chosen.

If you want join the effort, we encourage you to
[get in touch](mailto:project@scs.sovereignit.de) with us.
We will do a short onboarding session and invite you to weekly
virtual team meetings.

We also appreciate occasional feedback from people -- feel
free to raise issues on github or better open PRs. Don't forget
to use DCO (Sign-off) to ensure we can use your contribution in
a legally safe way.
