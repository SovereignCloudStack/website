# website
## Build environment

The static [SCS website](https://scs.community) is generated by a `Makefile`, for which you need to have `make`, `sed`, `python-markdown`, `ImageMagick`, `cleancss`, and `html-minifier` installed.

On debian-based systems, the first packages can be installed via
```console
sudo apt-get install make sed python-markdown imagemagick cleancss
```

The JavaScript-based HTML minifier `html-minifier` can be globally installed with 
```console
npm install html-minifier -g
```

## Generate site

To generate the website, simply call
```
make
```
in the root directory. The result can then be found under `build/`.
