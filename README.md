The static [SCS website](https://scs.community) is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is originally based on the template [business-frontpage](https://github.com/sharu725/business-frontpage) by [sharu725](https://github.com/sharu725). We're heavily making use of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0) to layout the page content.

The website is automatically build every 15 minutes or on every push to `main` and subsequently deployed via `rsync` to our webspace.

## Adding content

### How can I publish a community blog posting?
Create a markup document located at `_i18n/en/blog` and/or respectively `_i18n/de/blog`  to add a new blog post. Be aware that the file shall be named `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP` according to the Jekyll conventions (see [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)).

### How can I create a new page?
Due to the internalization plugin, you have to create multiple files. First of all, add a new markup document under `_pages`, set the desired layout, e.g. `default` and add the line
```
{% tf pagetitle.MARKUP %}
```
Following this step, you have to create the documents `pagetitle.MARKUP` located at `_i18n/en` and `_i18n/de`. Note that you have to create at least the English translation or otherwise the build process will fail.

### How can I add a press release?
Add the press release to `_data/news_de.yml` for German speaking press release or `_data/news_en.yml` for English speaking releases.

### How can I add a new partner?
Upload the logo to `assets/images` and add a entry in `_data/supporter.yml`

### How can I add custom styling definitions (CSS code)?
As we're using Bootstrap, please add your custom styling definitions to `assets/css/_sass/custom.css`
