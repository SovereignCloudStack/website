Having been with Gonicus as a software developer since 2019, Sebastian has worked in a number of projects in varied backend and frontend roles, happy to be immersed in the world of OSS development. Outside of work, his special interest lies in the tools that enable people to bring their own ideas into beingâ€”or simply have some good, old fun.
