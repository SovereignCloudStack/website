bio: |
        Marc has been passionate about open source since the late 90's and has since spent his entire professional and personal life almost exclusively with open source technologies.

        As a systems engineer and developer (in recent years his profile can be very well described by the term Site Reliability Engineering), Marc has been responsible for mission-critical platforms for numerous companies and has contributed code, expertise, testing and ideas to many open source projects.

        As a Site Reliability Engineer, Marc takes care of the operability or non-functional properties (security, availability, scalability and efficiency) of SCS. This includes technical implementation and configuration details of individual components, but also structural aspects of SCS (architecture, operational concepts, processes, best practices).
