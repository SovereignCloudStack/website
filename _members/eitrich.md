bio: |
  After graduating from university, Eduard was part of a software development team and responsible for the release management of a Linux enterprise distribution. Following up his two-year parental leave, during which he orchestrated his twin daughters rather than continuous deployment pipelines, he became the head of digitalization and IT of the medium-sized town BÃ¼hl in southwestern Germany. From 2021 until 2023, Eduard empowered the Sovereign Cloud Stack community as Open Source Community Manager and enjoyed learning from a inspiring team and fellows.
