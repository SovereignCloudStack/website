# About Sovereign Cloud Stack

Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a network of existing and future providers
of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join
forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated,
compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support
a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen
the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to
lose control over the technology and the data.
