description: "StackHPC is one of the leading OpenStack consultancies working with research institutions worldwide. Formed in 2016, StackHPC has established a formidable reputation with eminent organisations developing OpenStack for their benefit and enabling OpenStack client teams to support their mission critical operations. StackHPC is a committed member of the Open Infrastructure Foundation and SCS Community.
Our focus is on the Research or Scientific Computing landscape where the demands of high performance computing can place exacting requirements on the underlying configuration of the infrastructure, especially when dealing with the software-defined complexities of modern on-premise cloud infrastructure, together with extending this model to hybrid cloud environments. While Research Computing remains our focus, we also support clients across the industrial, retail and financial sectors who share a similar mission in performance."
