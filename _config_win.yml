title: Sovereign Cloud Stack
tagline: Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is cloud technology built entirely with Open Source Software â€” as an alternative to propietary cloud technology.
description: Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a network of existing and future providers of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to lose control over the technology and the data.
